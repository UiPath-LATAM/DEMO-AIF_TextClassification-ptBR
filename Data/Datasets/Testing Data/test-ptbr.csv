cdb,"My ex husband left the apartment we were living in and sticking me with the only one paying the lease. We were 6 months into a 1 year lease. After he left i could no longer  afford to pay the lease so i worked out a deal with the rental company to get out of the lease. I left the apartment in great condition and had another person set to take over the lease after i moved out. However, I now have a collection company attempting to collect a XXXX dollars. There is no way that i owed that much even if i hadn't arranged everything. I've tried to call the company and also sent in things to the credit bureaus but nothing is working and they refuse to send me a breakdown of the bill."
Mortgage,XXXX XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/2018 notified me of a 30 day late payment on my mortgage through my mortgage company Freedom Mortgage. I pay my mortgage electronically through my banking institution and have never been late with mortgage payments in 16 years. The issue is the escrow increased and I was not notified.

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",I had a loan with a monthly payment of {$86.00} a month on the XXXX if each month. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$480.00} and my regular loan payment for that month. The {$480.00} payment was entered as an adjustment and not a payment and no interest was taken off even though I paid almost 6 extra payments. When I called to inquire about why no interest was credited I was told that I paid all of the interest in the beginning of the loan. I paid the loan off a year early but was on credited about {$80.00} in interest when I paid {$280.00} this week. I was told there was no penalty to pay it off early but I paid the entire loan plus all interest but {$80.00}. I have enclosed copy of check sent to make payment and my monthly statement showing it was posted as an adjustment not a check payment.

cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"I had a Wells Fargo cartao credito involved in the XXXX Wells Fargo account fraud scandal in which Wells Fargo sales representatives without consent of pre-approved customers created fraudulent charge accounts and collecting fees. Wells Fargo 's corrupt actions resulted in a multiple XXXX dollar law suit and settlement on thousands of accounts. I disputed on several occasions providing written complaints with wells Fargo in XXXX and XXXX. I explained that I was paying my account monthly through their electronic payment process which was suddenly stopped in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Wells Fargo and was advised that they had no record of my account. I never received any written, telephonic or electronic notification from Wells Fargo since that time. Upon review my recent credit report it revealed that Wells Fargo had closed my account, charged late fees, and charged off the account as a bad debt. I was never received any written notification or telephone calls from any collection agency regarding my account. As a result of their action my credit score was damaged. In XX/XX/XXXX, I again contacted Wells Fargo by telephone and was again advised that they had no record of my account and hung up. I would like the CFBP to look into this improper consumer behavior and assist me in resolving this matter."

A second purchase was made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$59.00} which was part of the next statement that closed on XX/XX/XXXX with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX. The statement that closed on XX/XX/XXXX also included a {$27.00} late fee. I was able to have that waived after having to explain that the items from the XX/XX/XXXX purchase were returned and full credit was applied which should apply to the balance due for that billing cycle, as since the item was returned I would not be responsible to pay for it. As a result of not paying a payment in XX/XX/XXXX they have flagged the account as past due for failure to pay additionally they have shut down my online access to make the payment that is due on XX/XX/XXXX for the second purchase of {$59.00}, leaving the only way to pay is over the phone or in person. Two issues of concern - One how many others are paying late fees or interest for returned items. Secondly and equally important is that they are reporting to the credit bureau inaccurate information lowering credit scores."
Mortgage,"Borrower continued to make payments, including XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, however the mortgage company stated that payments were never received. Borrower called regarding the money orders and received proof that money orders were cashed by lender. The borrower did not want to pay additional payments as borrower believed payments were current. Loan is now in foreclosure. Borrower sent out a QWR letter XX/XX/XXXX requesting for payment history to determine or prove that payments were received. Lender never responded to QWR letter as of today. Lender 's counsel was asked the status of the response of QWR letter at the last conciliation conference on XX/XX/XXXX but lender 's counsel had no knowledge. Housing counselor submitted a copy of QWR letter along with receipt of certified mail to lender 's counsel on XX/XX/XXXX. Lender has neglected to send any proof of payment history to reflect that XX/XX/XXXX and payments after were late."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","While checking report today, I saw that there was a derogatory condition for collections on my credit report and I started to get details from my bank and finally got to speak to the debt collector named I C SYSTEM INC. When I called them to inquire about the reporting condition, I was told that its a medical bill from my doctors visit on XX/XX/XXXX, I asked them if they tried calling me or send any mail. The lady over the phone was skeptical to give those details, she put call on hold 3-4 times and she stated that they sent a mail in XX/XX/XXXX, she initially mentioned that the mail got back to them. I have no recollection about the letter for collections being sent to my home address. 
The lady also told me after further investigation from her end that they tried calling me twice, but they did not leave any voicemails, everything seems sketchy to me. I feel that I am a victim of I C SYSTEM Inc 's negligence and lack of responsibility in collecting the right way and they just reported my credit stating I am not responding or paying the amount ( {$91.00} ). I have asked them to mail me the statement or charges from the doctors office, for which the lady said she doesnot have it and she has to request it. I dont understand how they can collect when they dont have details of collection. 

I have made the payment today to get out of the situation."
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"First, I apologize this may not be the correct place to ask this question, but we can not find the answer anywhere.

Several weeks ago our customers ' purchases starting getting declined by one cartao credito company, Capital One. After several days we realized this and suggested the customer 's call Capital One for additional information. However many call us back saying the Capital One call center agent told them they are not blocking the purchase.

One customer conferenced in Capital One while on the phone with us and a manager was brought to the phone. She did verify that they no longer allow the cartao to be used to purchase our product - we are a XXXX XXXX - although we are selling a legal product.

Of course we realize Capital One has the right to bar purchases but aren't they required to educate their staff about changes and inform the customer?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Yes a lot of collections on my account that I didnt authorize it I am a victim of identity theft so let a lot of stuff shouldnt be on my credit please dispute all them not the car loan every thing else thanks
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have previously tried corrrecting the issue with the company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- however they only show to have XXXX   out the balance not clear it. I have tried to dispute the info with TransUnion and they have yet to return with info.
cdb,I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX - in XXXX Texas stating I owed a debt for an apt complex. The account was in another name the year before and it was taken off all credit reports. Account seems to have been bought and back on my credit reports- when I sent a letter demanding the original debt proof etc the letter was returned to me unable to deliver- The address on my credit report and the letter it is the same but yet no contact since then but they have managed to have my credit score go down over 45 points for no good reason.
Student loan,"I have calculated my interest down to the day for how much I am losing. Navient is stealing an extra day every month from me since my loan started. If they are doing this to everyone that is a large sum of money. I calculated the same thing with XXXX and they are not doing the same as Navient. Also if you go through the history of my loans when I just mailed in the amount I was told I owed for the month, they did not allocate my payments correctly. Since they have allowed access online I have not had this issue, as they must apply my payments as I note them. Although the first month I did this 3 years ago they tried to misappropriate my payments again. Which took 3 months to fix. I borrowed less than {$70000.00} and graduated in XX/XX/2007 and I have paid them {$100000.00} and I still owe them {$10000.00}. People that have borrowed from Sallie Mae/Navient please be aware of where your payments are going."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I was told repeatly that there was not any origination or up front fees with this loan when I spoke numerous times with account representative on the phone. 

When loan dispersed I was charged a origination fee of {$480.00} on the {$8000.00} loan. 

I called numerous times to Lending Club XXXX only to be put on hold and then hung up on, told they would look into it and get back to me, and refused to let me speak with a supervisor. 

I then sent them a letter and email regarding my issues they then debited my checking account 4 days early for the monthly payment which caused issues with my checking account overdraft. 

I called again about both of these issues and was again told someone would address my problems but they never called or emailed me. 

I proceeded to close my checking account so they could no longer debit it. 

They violated the terms of our agreement/contract on origination fee and early debiting my checking prior to the agreed due date of a payment. 

Lending Club never addressed my issues and sent the account to a collection agency. I have been receiving harrasing phone calls from 4 different agencies/legal that claim to have the account, and my credit reports shows chargoff and collections."

Student loan,"I refinanced my student loans with Earnest. Today they sent out an email that they are changing how auto payments can be scheduled. According to them : "" Starting on XX/XX/XXXX, biweekly Auto Pay will not be available. '' To top it off, changes to Auto Pay now have to go through contacting customer service instead of being managed directly online.

Effectively Earnest is going to make loans harder for everyone to pay. I enjoy my biweekly auto payments because it helps me pay everything off faster.

The email reads : "" Moving forward, Auto Pay can only be scheduled for the XXXX of any given monthother days will not be supported. If your current Auto Pay date falls within that range, no action is required. If it falls outside this range, please sign in to your Earnest account by XX/XX/XXXX to choose your desired payment date between the XXXX and XXXX. If your XXXX Auto Pay date is outside the supported range on XX/XX/XXXX, your payment will be automatically pushed to XX/XX/XXXX. 

After XX/XX/XXXX, changes to your Auto Pay dates must be made directly with our XXXX XXXX team, rather than through your client dashboard. Well keep you posted once you can do so through your dashboard. 
Starting on XX/XX/XXXX, biweekly Auto Pay will not be available. Any clients paying twice per month are requested to sign in to their Earnest account to select a new monthly payment schedule. If you dont do so by XX/XX/XXXX, the system will automatically select a payment date that will be at least a month after your last biweekly payment. We are exploring a number of alternative biweekly payment options between now and XX/XX/XXXX. We will update this Help Center article in the coming weeks once we have settled on a solution. 
Rest assured that the terms, conditions, and benefits of your Earnest student loan refinance have not changed, and neither has access to our team of Client Happiness experts. More details on whats changing can be found in our Help Center article here. ''"

Vehicle loan or lease,"I used to send a few months at a time by mail to pay my loan payment with Nissan. I noticed and started get calls from Nissan that my payments had not been received. It started taking longer and longer for my checks to be cashed by Nissan. I received another call explaining my account was about to be late for my  XX/XX/XXXX payment. I explained my check was in the mail. The collector said he could take a payment over the phone but at the time I could not afford for the check and the phone payment to clear. Magically my check cleared shortly after the phone call. I immediately stopped mailing checks and started using their online system. It must be nice to be able to hold checks to create late payments. As you can see from my electronic payments always timely. Either this company is trying to create extra money with late fees, trying to discourage people from mailing checks to use online payments, or there was a mailing issue. 
I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was told I would get a response in 15 days. I did not. I contacted XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX and was told Nissan could not change it without getting fined by CFPB As one can see from my 30 plus years of credit history there has never been a over 30 day late. How is it fair credit reporting with most of my payments are over 30 days in advance and they don't report that."

I need help getting my APR lowered so I can pay this loan off sooner because they are gouging me with all their fees.

It was initially sent to a law firm that I set up monthly payments with and had been faithfully making them for quite a while, and then they suddenly stopped. A month or two later, I receive an introduction letter from Blitt & Gaines our of XXXX, Illinois saying they were taking over the debt. I dont recall anything in the letter stating I needed to contact them or something bad would happen. I assumed they would contact me with what they wanted me to do because thats their job as debt collectorXXXX. This was months ago, possibly as far back as XX/XX/2018. I didnt hear anything else from them until my bank account was frozen yesterday, XX/XX/2018. When I called the law firm, someone there stated they only did it because they tried to garnish my wages but I didnt work there. She named a company Ive never even heard of, let alone worked at. At the time Blitt & Gaines reportedly tried to garnish my wages in XXXX, I had had the same job for over two years. I file taxes. I get direct deposit. How could they not find my actual job? I received no communication that the wage garnishment was unsuccessful and they needed job information from me. I have not moved. I have not changed my phone number. The only thing the woman kept telling me was that it was my fault that I didnt respond to the letter from XXXX. I feel like this frozen bank account could have been avoided and now I dont know how Im going to pay my bills the rest of the month. I dont really have family to ask for help so this is really terrifying. Furthermore, wage garnishment would not have been necessary because I would have wanted to set up a similar payment plan as to what I had before and assumed I would have again. But they did not contact me and took the most drastic action without even informing me ahead of time."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I am a XXXX XXXX and receive only one paycheck over summer. So on XX/XX/2018 I submitted three months of payments for my loan with Santander Bank. 

On XX/XX/2018 I called because I was unable to view my account online. 

When I called the women informed me that I was delinquent. 

When I asked why I didnt have access to my account she said I couldnt have access because I had filed Bankruptcy. 

This seemed like odd news since I obtained this car loan two years after filing bankruptcy and had historically had access.

When I questioned this she told me that they had changed their policy and would now only allow you to prepay payments for up to two months. This was never disclosed to me. Nor was their new inability to grant me visibility online to my account. 

I was told that I need to pay an extra payment to now bring my account current. 

This appears to be both unfair and deceptive lending practices to me as a consumer."

We leased from XXXX XXXX ... which has gone out of business and is now owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have sent two responses along with a copy of the lease with highlighted section showing the penalty/fee does not apply to us to both XXXX XXXX and Honda Financial Services..

I repeatedly emailed XXXX XXXX ( VP of Consumer Communications ) and XXXX XXXX ( Head of Compliance ) and my efforts to understand why I was charged this additional amount were completely ignored. I had a 30 year conventional loan - there should have been no charges incurred in early payoff. This company has been a never ending, unethical nightmare to deal with. This is the 3rd CFPB complaint I have had to file as none of my efforts in dealing with them directly have been successful. I want a valid explanation of this charge and if it was calculated and levied in error, I want a refund processed immediately."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","received 2 title loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. payments were made and then fell in to a financial problem. hours of work were cut and income went down and then both vehicles went down with problems. couldnt make payments for a while and then went to collections. received calls from a XXXX XXXX from CU Recovery. he called my work in XX/XX/2018 and spoke with him. he said to call him back in which we did. he wanted my wife to take loan out of her 401k to pay him which we explained we couldnt do it because we had taken a loan out already for medical costs. next he wanted us to take out a loan from family or friends and explained we couldnt ... nobody had the amount he was wanting. he even trheatened to sue us, which scared my wife. anyway on that call we made arrangements to use our tax refund when we received it to pay him but told him we would not get it for a couple of months. we made the agreement that we would pay XXXX a month until tax return came and then pay the balance of which was {$3000.00} and he said once we paid the settlement offer off, we would get our vehicle titles back. we paid this off and got a notification letter from XXXX XXXX that it was paid. last we have heard from him about anything. have tried calling the number that he would use to call constantly and have texted but no replies have been received from XXXX XXXX at CU Recovery. We did our part and paid off the settlement offer in full, now we are expecting CU Recovery and XXXX XXXX to fulfill their part! all we want is our vehicles titles ... they acted on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX part..so they are soley responsible for this matter."
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"Apparently I had a missed payment that I did not know about until an app that tracks my finances notified me about a finance charge. I then logged into my cartao account to pay my bill as a finance charge means there is a late fee. Upon logging in, I see that my account has been closed. I spoke to two operators using chat and 3 operators using the call line. The told me they closed my account due to 2 missed payments over a 24 month period. Not once was I notified that this could happen, wasn't notified that 45 days in advance for major change to cartao credito account, and wasn't notified immediately after. I tried to resolve the situation and they told me there was nothing they could do even after being a customer for so long. I do not feel that this is right. Especially since I immediately payed once I realized the mistake. I've only ever missed one other payment the entire time that I have had the cartao and i got the cartao in XX/XX/2013."
Mortgage,"I originally received my mortgage loan from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and I felt they were great. I did run into some hardships with them and was late on a few payments in XXXX but with there patients I got caught up in XXXX. In XXXX they sold my loan to Penny Mac. Penny Mac has been nothing short of fraudulent since then. 

In the months of XX/XX/XXXX, Penny Mac, my loan provider waited until after the due date of XX/XX/XXXX to process my payment and charged me a fee of approximately {$100.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX the payment line of Penny Mac was down and I could not make a payment until the XXXX and they charged me another late fee of approximately {$100.00}. I called several times after that only to enter a phone tree in which I could never talk to anyone. When I finally talked to someone they said they would wave the fees in which they never have. I have called several times and Penny Mac representatives said they would wave the fee but they never have. 
In late XXXX I noticed an additional fee under other fees which was approximately XXXX dollars but continued to go up every month. I called several times to ask what it was for and never really got a good answer. Today, I opened my latest bill and the "" Other Fees '' had reached {$24.00} so I called Penny Mac. The Penny Mac representative said the fee was because my Mortgage was delinquent from the XXXX incident described above and I would have to pay this fee to "" have someone come to my house to make sure someone was still living there FOR THE LIFE OF THE LOAN ''. This is clear Fraud as no one has stopped by my house to make sure I am present. This is clearly Fraud because I was never late on my loan with Penny Mac."
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,I just got a XXXX Mastercartao with a {$500.00} credit line and they took around {$120.00} immediately so your available line is {$370.00}. That is terrible but not even the worst of there service policies. XX/XX/2018 I made a payment of {$35.00} using their website and set it up has a checking ACH. My balance owed before this transaction was {$510.00} overdrawn due to their fees they took from my account. The {$35.00} payment did not even post to the cartao until XX/XX/2018 and it only reflexted in my owed balance but still not available. My balance on their screen was {$440.00} but my available balance was still in the negative. I asked for a direct debit from my checking and it takes 7 to 10 days to become available? You have to call and pay a fee of {$10.00} to get your funds sooner than 7_10 day 's. You can not even set up a reoccurring monthly debit using your debit cartao and I mentioned any payment using a checking by any way takes 7-10 days to become available. The only way to get your funds available is to call and pay a {$10.00} Fee!!! This I believe is a violation of the funds availability act and other acts as well as being one point from a scam. This company should be audited by the correct authorities to see how they are violating certain acts. I want my balance to be XXXX and wiped out by them. No reflection on my credit and close the cartao as per my request and have no negative reflection on any of my credit reports or I will go public or escalate this to a higher authority. All I said is true so there is no chance I am commiting a defamation or Libel offense against them
cdb,I have no knowledge of this account or who it belongs to. It is incorrectly reporting on my credit reports.
Vehicle loan or lease,"At the end of the lease on my vehicle in XX/XX/XXXX I turned the vehicle in to XXXX XXXX XXXX, with the purchase of a new vehicle. XXXX XXXX XXXX obtained a buyout figure from Ford Motor Credit and sent them a check. At that time, all the paperwork from the original leased vehicle was turned over to XXXX XXXX XXXX, taking all responsibilities away from me, the leasee. Sometime in late XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter in the mail from Ford Motor Credit stating that they extended my lease due to lack of payment. At that time, I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX and found out that they had sent the check to the wrong location. While I was at XXXX XXXX XXXX, the two companies worked it out, and everything was paid in full. In XX/XX/XXXX, I  received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX again, stating again that I was behind on my payments. At that time, I found that my XXXX XXXX went from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I called Ford Credit, and filed a complaint explaining the situation. I received a follow-up phone call stating everything was taken care of and that letter had been sent out in error and that they were taking immediate action to rectify my credit score. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and my credit score has not only NOT come up, but I am now receiving letters from my cartao credito companies saying that my interest rates have been raised due to a lowered credit score.I would appreciate a response to this inquiry to that I know it has been sent to the correct place and that someone will get in touch with me to rectify the matter. My email is XXXX and my cell # is XXXX. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"My understanding of the cartao credito act in 2010 is that any payment made above the minimum should be allocated to the highest interest rate on the account. Ive been told by employees that they can allocate my payment however they want. I was also told they allocate my payment to the lower interest rate first. 

My balance is divided into 2 portions, one is purchases being charged at 21-25 %. The other is a balance transfer being charged at 0 %. So in this situation my minimum payment was {$130.00}. I paid over {$2000.00} this was to not only cover the minimum But to cover some purchases. However I was still charged interest and given not only conflicting information but information that is illegal."
Student loan,"I have been place under XXXX XXXX without my consent. 

My loans were originally under XXXX. I made payments to them starting in XX/XX/XXXX when my 6 month deferment period after graduation had ended. I enrolled in the Income Based Repayment Plan and made payments of {$130.00} monthly. 

I then had my loans transferred to XXXX XXXX from XXXX  because I enrolled in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX program. I was eligible through my employment at the XXXX XXXX  XXXX starting in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I faced problems initially when my loans were transferred because they lost my XX/XX/XXXX payment and did not recover it till XX/XX/XXXX. But this was only the beginning and is not the main issue I am concerned about. 

I made payments of {$130.00} every month on time until XX/XX/XXXX when my account was put into XXXX XXXX without my consent. I qualified for deferment when I was accepted for my masters at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. However, in NO way did I want my loans put into deferment as my interest would begin to capitalize. I am also capable of making the payments. So why would XXXX XXXX put me into deferment with no authorization or reason to believe I could not make my payment? 

I have no idea and it seems neither did the agent at XXXX XXXX I called. She said this has been happening a lot and that it should not be without an application for XXXX XXXX. She said they will send me an application in 7-10 days to get out of deferment ... Of course during this time my interest is capitalizing. 

I am very concerned about this as it seems this is a VERY common issue with this loan servicer. Please contact me as soon as you can, I would be happy to speak more about this. I know XXXX is currently undergoing an investigation over this same issue."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I received a letter from the IRS stating that someone was applying for a job by using my social security number. They provided websites of the 3 credit reporting agencies where I could obtain a free credit report. 

Transunion required a cartao credito as part of a log-in and did not display a price for services. I had searched registration page each step of the way for dollar signs and there were none. Transunion proceeded to charge my cartao {$19.00} and enroll me in a monthly service at a price of $ XXXX/mo.

I called and told them that there was no such authorization to charge my cartao. They said that they would end my subscription and that the initial {$19.00} is non-refundable. 

This is inappropriate, as they did not request on the webpage that they could charge my cartao for this service. At the very least, they are engaged in deceptive practices."
Checking or savings account,"Capital One has not provided requested info which includes their PHYSICAL mailing address for notice of small claim suit as well as name and number of their legal council. I've requested this information numerous times via complaints to CFPB, a XXXX XXXX replies with a web site address, does not provide PHYSICAL address or name and number of their legal council. The small claim suit is regarding a stop payment on a close out check in error on end of Capital One, reissued and intercepted by a third party, cashed fraudulently in my name. Capital One has my signature on file and is well aware the signature on check is not mine, insists the person whom cashed check lives at my address and is related, does not have proof funds were received by myself, which they were not.

In her last reply to CFPB, she stated she will not keep replying but refuses to provide a physical mailing address ... She provides her number in correspondences but does not return calls, a total of seven ( 7 )  messages left, none returned..The CFPB might be able to step in this matter to assist in resolution ..."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed an unauthorized transaction of {$470.00} pending on my account. I called PNC and told them I did not authorize that transaction, so Im requesting that they not pay it. They said there is nothing they can do until the payment is posted. I waited overnight for the payment to post, and hoped they would have listened to my request, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IN MY ACCOUNT TO PAY THE TRANSACTION. Any reasonable person would have thought that if the customer called in about the transaction, and said they didnt authorize it, AND there is NOT SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO PAY THE TRANSACTION, AND, the BANK HAS THE DESCRETION OF RETURNING THE ITEM, as they have done in the past, why would the bank choose to go ahead and pay it with THEIR FUNDS,, then CHARGE ME ALL KINDS OF FEES, and put my account into a state of overdraft. 

PNC HAS THE DESCRETION OF EITHER PAYING OR RETURNING AN ITSM, FOR WHICH THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FUNDS. PNC CHOSE TO PAY IT, EVEN AGAINST MY WISHES, WHICH THEY KNEW ABOUT BEFORE POSTING THE TRANSACTION. 

I called and filed the dispute after the transaction was posted and the bank told me they can not do any conditional credit until the 10 days it takes to process the dispute, while PNC Bank will charge me DAILY fees until they resolve the dispute! Now ALL my scheduled transactions will be returned, including my car insurance, just because PNC decided to use their funds to pay a transaction I told them I did not authorize, and there was no money in my account to pay it and my account is messed up. 

PNC could have issued the conditional credit, and I could have deposited the smaller amount the account would have been overdrawn by, and my account would have been fine. Now, I do not have the use of my account because PNC decided to use their money to pay a transaction I alerted them about."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I took out the loan on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told at the time of the sale by the dealer and the finance company told me the same thing that I could refinance after 12 months of paying my payment on time. Not true. I would have never signed any paperwork at this amount knowing that I couldn't get a lower interest rate. I have completely struggled to pay my car payment over the last 4 years. I finally got my credit score so that I could trade it in but over the last few months Ive been in a traumatic apartment rental. I never received any paperwork about my car being reposed in fact the day before it was repoed I got a rehabilitation email saying they would work with me so that I could keep my car. They never gave me a chance to respond because the car was taken a few hours after I got that email. I called about how much I need and the first amount I was told was XXXX then I got paperwork dated XX/XX/XXXX and the amount was XXXX then I called again just to see what I would be told and it was XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and requested them to email me the amounts and was emailed another customers load paperwork. I called to alert them and at first I was told that they don't make mistakes like that but then I started reading it to them. They took the account # and asked me what I was going to do about it. This morning I called the New York State Attorney General 's office and they told me that it is against the law what they have done. But my question is that can not guarantee that they sent the other person my paperwork. I have asked for the return of my vehicle, the derogatory marks off of my credit, and forgiveness of the remainder of the loan. At first they were going to return my vehicle and refinance my loan, but my payment didn't change and I still owe 24 months of the loan. My privacy has been violated and they act like it's nothing."

Student loan,"This is the letter I sent to the XXXX XXXX center outlining the details of my complaint : XXXX XXXX Dispute Center : I am a consumer with a clean repayment history over 14 years of repayment on student loans both XXXX and XXXX since initial disbursement in XXXX. 
Account # XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX I re-financed my student loan to a private lender to save on my interest rate. In XX/XX/XXXX my XXXX was paid in full by XXXX XXXX. 

During the interim as the bank paid out and you ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) received and credited the payment, I continued to make my payments diligently. As a result, I accrued a credit of {$2700.00}, due to XXXX XXXX over paying the balance on my account. 

I was told it would take 30-60 days for this reimbursement to be credited back to XXXX XXXX. 

At 3 months ( I waited 90 days to allow reasonable time for processing ) when I had not seen the credit go though, I called XXXX XXXX to inquire. At this time I found out the reimbursement had not even been initiated ( XX/XX/XXXX ) leaving the representative I spoke with confused as to why it was taking so long. He told me if I did not hear anything in 5-7 business days to call back. Because I am an extremely busy professional and my time is valuable I did not have a chance to call back right away. But I have overall spent at least 3 calls with wait times to XXXX XXXX as well as checking with my new loan servicer on a quick and helpful phone call to them to make sure the reimbursement was in fact not received. The representative at my new loan servicing center was shocked to see the reimbursement had not gone through noting we generally would have received it by now. This is further evidence XXXX XXXX did not process my refund in a timely manner. 

MY DILIGENCE. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a very helpful XXXX ID # XXXX who took a lot of time researching the refund and didnt seem to have clear records so I had to tell her the situation, but she was able to see that the refund had been initiated on XX/XX/XXXX and should be to XXXX XXXX in ANOTHER 30 days. She tried to deter me by stating there was no way they could authorize and additional refund and when I asked to speak with someone who could she put me through to XXXX at ID # XXXX, XXXX was unfriendly and unhelpful and a brick wall for answers, she told me to write a letter. 

After hours spent on the phone, months of waiting I am asking that you REVIEW MY ACCOUNT, I believe there was negligence on XXXX part on not issuing my refund in a TIMELY manner, costing me at LEAST ( I rounded down my conservative estimate ) {$130.00} of added cost paying interest on money I had already paid to XXXX XXXX and money I had already paid interest on. 



MY REQUEST An additional amount of {$130.00} be issued ( via the same route the {$2700.00} was issued ) to XXXX XXXX to decrease the principle loan amount as owed to me due to XXXX XXXX delay in timely reimbursement. 

If I had delayed a payment to XXXX XXXX for 2-4 months I would have been charged significantly more than this in fees and finance charges. I am NOT asking for compensation for my time nor the amount of income XXXX XXXX likely made on that money over the 6 months my refund was delayed. 

SUMMARY I have had an exemplary repayment history and I request that you reward my diligence by admitting your error in untimely processing of the refund of over payment and providing restitution to correct this error. I believe this request is reasonable and fair. 

This letter has been copied and submitted to Oregon State Representatives and the XXXX XXXX XXXX 


I expect this {$130.00} refund be issued and Credited to XXXX XXXX in an efficient, timely and reasonable manner. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX keeps reporting incorrect information about late payments to my credit report. They have a different date for the 30 days late each time I dispute. I provide proof of the on time payments, it gets removed and then a month or so later they are back again reporting incorrect dates. Now they are reporting 2 late payments instead of one. This should be illegal. Its really unethical that the credit bureau companies keep reporting this information even after I show proof the payments were on time.

I was told repeatedly that the equity line of credit account had been written off/forgiven and that I did not have to make any further payments. 

The first loan was modified. 

Subsequently, there has been a circus of mishandling the equity line of credit involving Wells Fargo lying to me constantly about whether the loan was written off or not. Eventually, the home was put into foreclosure. 

Now after three years I have been told there was insurance after all and that the equity line of credit has been paid off and the balance is XXXX  and the lien has been released. Hopefully that's true, but I haven't seen it in writing yet. 

OK now my complaint is that I was wrongly told there was no mortgage insurance and was put through XXXX and expenses I could not afford. Furthermore, I believe a the time of XXXXXXXX XXXX death, we had insurance against the first loan as well. Since Wells Fargo was negligent regarding insurance on the second equity line of credit, they were probably wrong about the first mortgage. 

Please conduct an investigation into the mishandling of my mortgages after the death of my husband, Please determine whether I had mortgage insurance at the time of XXXX death on both loans and whether the first mortgage should have been paid off by the insurance company prior to modification. 

Thank you.

cdb,"Bank of America is in violation of the RESPA guidelines under category 1, 7, 9 and 10.

Under category 1, the Bank created the problem by not presenting XXXX payment by automatic draft. The reason it gave initially was that it was by law, changed later to "" it is the bank 's guideline '', to finally it is updating its ACH processing. Upon receipt of a default notice and intention to accelerate in late XXXX, I went to the XXXX branch to make the two months payment which were available in the checking account. It refused, and instructed the XXXX branch manager not to accept any payment from any unauthorized third party. It had received the documents I submitted establishing me as the successor trustee. It took the Bank more than four months to accept those documents and establish me as an authorized person to contact. I offered to resume payments beginning XX/XX/XXXX, and begin paying down the unpaid principal and interest. Again, it refused. 

Under category 7, the bank kept on changing the options available to me for loss mitigation. First, I was told that I can qualify for loan assumption if I, the successor trustee, become the borrower, not the trust. That was turned down. Then, I was offered short sale agreement that would give me 45 to 120 days to market the property. When I asked for the short sale agreement document that I can sign my name on, I was told that it was not an option because the appraised value of the property is more than the outstanding principal balance. Then it said that the options left available are reinstatement which required putting up more than $ 15K, or foreclosure. Clearly, the bank just wants to foreclose on the property. It sees to benefit more by foreclosing on the property, then keeping it under its REO department. That way, it collects the {$1200.00} rent from a good paying tenant which is more than the $ 1100 monthly payment for principal, interest, insurance and real estate taxes.

Under category 9, the bank did not do its due diligence review of the loan assumption/loan mitigation application. It has already made the decision to deny the application based on the reason that it is an investment property. THE BANK REFINANCED THIS LOAN ON XXXX AS AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY. I also submitted the lease it requested as a supporting documentation. In its letter of XX/XX/XXXX, it said that it has received the application, but I have not submitted the package until the next day, XX/XX/XXXX. Then, it sent another letter on XX/XX/XXXX saying that it is concluding its review of the application when the loan assumption/loan modification units of the bank has already turned down the application on XX/XX/XXXX. I believe that the bank is gaming the system. It has established first a sale date, then sent me letters to conform to deadlines in its responses. The XX/XX/XXXX letter is five days from the XX/XX/XXXX letter. The XX/XX/XXXX denial of the application is 30 days from the sale date. The XX/XX/XXXX decision was arrived in indecent haste because it was the same day that it confirmed receipt of the application. The is clearly trying to make it look like it is complying with the guidelines of RESPA and other applicable laws. 
Under category 10, and closely related to category 9, the  bank has already established a sale date of XX/XX/XXXX even before it has received the application for loan assumption/loan modification. It never reviewed the application. Instead, it has made its decision to foreclose on the property. 
Through all this discussion, I have concluded that the Bank is dealing in bad faith and is engaged in unfair business practices."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a small personal Loan with one main financial. I was going to use my XXXX vehicle as collateral. I was asked to come into the office to sign final papers and I went to the XXXX Maryland office and spoke with XXXX. After signing papers and my title, giving all my copies of social security number and personal information, one main told me I could come and pick up my check within a day or two. Later that day or the next morning, I received a call saying that I needed a co-signer which I didnt understand why.. I told them that I didnt have a co-signer and due to the change, I didnt want the loan. I told XXXX I would be there to pick up my documents. When I went, she wasnt there and no one could find my folder. I have still not received any of my documents, including my car title or any of my personal information that I am not comfortable with floating around. I had to go to MVA and pay for another copy of my title. 
Recently, I needed to sell my vehicle due to more medical bills due to an illness. I spoke with my insurance company to let them know I was selling the car. They ( XXXX XXXX ) informed me there is a lien on my vehicle from One main Financial. I have tried to call the XXXX office three times. I have asked for manager and each time, manager is not in. I have tried to call the corporate number but am not able to get to a person and asked to leave messages that are not returned. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX from one main in XXXX. I again asked for manager and told she wasnt in. I told her what the issue is and I need the lien removed ASAP. I gave her all my information because she said Im not in their system. I told her time is a factor because I am going to loose the person that is buying my car which will be literally devastating financially and medically. She told me she has two people out and will do it when she has time. I again almost begged and she said when she has time but she isnt holding on a line because they have clients to take care of. She proceeded to say anything else?? I said no and thanked her for her time. 
The company comes up as onemain financial, one main financial and/or onemain financial holdings LLC so I am unclear if they are one in the same"
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",The interest is ridiculous I have been paying XXXX monthly for 5 months and still arent done paying till XX/XX/XXXX. I only borrowed {$800.00}.
cdb,"I received a letter in the mail stating I owed my previous bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a balance of {$120.00}. Since I closed my account about a year ago, I knew something was wrong and wondered if the teller did not close my account correctly. I went into the branch near my home and got evidence that showed I have never had this debt and that I have never been sent to any collection agency. The teller I spoke to said that XXXX has not used XXXX XXXX XXXX in a few years and that they recently switched systems and a few of these letters have gone out and worried members have brought them into the branch wondering what they were about. She suggested that I call the toll-free number on the cartao, and nobody answered. I left a message and received a call back a few minutes later. The man I spoke to, XXXX XXXX, asked me to verify the day I was born and the very last digit of my social security cartao. I gave him the information because I didnt think he could do anything with such a small amount of information and told him I went into the bank and was told and given evidence that this debt does not exist. He asked who I spoke to, and when, and asked if i went into the branch physically. I said I spoke to a teller about 30 minutes prior to the phone call, and went to the physical location. I was a bit angry because I know I have never been sent to collections, and could not tell me any details on this apparent debt I owed. He said he needed to contact the issuer who gave him my case and that he would call me back. It has been over 24 hours and I have not received a call back from him. Today I did some research and found his business online, but the address does not match the address on the letter, nor does the address on his website match a legitiment address on XXXX maps. The website address is XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX is reporting that I have two outstanding loan balances through Department of Education-Nelnet as of  XX/XX/XXXX.

I have submitted two disputes ( once in XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX ) with information documenting both showing {$0.00} balance and both disputes have been denied. 

I submitted my Loan Summary/Mortgage Verification letter ( the only letter Nelnet was able to give me ) and my StudentDataDocument from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - both showing I have a XXXX balance for all my student loan accounts. 

XXXX  has denied both my disputes saying the information being reported is correct. They have documentation showing Nelnet "" reported '' balances on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon contacting the creditor, Nelnet, they are showing they have not reported anything to XXXX  since XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I call XXXX they say that Nelnet is still reporting ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) that they balances are correct. I have submitted all the documentation that I have showing the accounts are paid off. I don't know if XXXX is wrong or Nelnet is wrong but the information being reported on my XXXX  credit report is incorrect. The balances have been paid off ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) and should be removed from my credit report. 

I called XXXX and Nelnet multiple times to get this resolved and they were unable to handle my request. I think it is ridiculous that CRA 's and creditors are able to report incorrect information about me and yet are unable to give me a straight answer via a simple phone call. These are billion dollar organizations and I am having to solve these issues from my kitchen table. These organizations should be held to a higher standard when it comes to servicing the people they are profiting from."

They refer me to the account statements and other communications, yet these documents do not specify the opening dates. They refer me to my nearest HSBC branch, which is 25 miles from my home.

Mortgage,"My complaint is against Chase and some of their practice 's they have done. Chase over charging me not credit crediting me properly. increasing my monthly fixed loan payments totally unauthorized.

Chase on there own accord just changed the term of my initial loan agreement from 20 years to 30 years actually ripping me the cosumer off This is totally unsatisfactory to me I don't believe chase practices allows them to do this costing the consumers more money without the consumer having knowledge about it the changes they made that I didn't agree to. 
And they done twisted this paperwork up so much their own representatives in the Chase XXXX branch can't even explain what's happened and they don't understand it I spoke it to XXXX and the female manager there she gave me papers that say I owe 224 more months at XXXX that's not accurate. This discrepancy was brought to my attention by XXXX call me said I need to refinance cause this loan is way too much you can wait too much and that's when he told me i had a 30 year loan instead of a 20 year fixed. So no one know what's going on but I'm the 1 to suffer it's not fair it's unsatisfactorily and I'm not going to tolerate that.

XX/XX/2007 I open a home equity loan with Washington Mutual bank. They transferred the loan to Chase I've been making payments in the amount of XXXX per month as per my fixed loan agreement. That was my fixed rate for 20 years. I was instructed by Washington Mutual that as time went on any extra money I would borrow would be at a 6.5 % neutral rate. I was also instructed that any money I send in extra monthly over the XXXX will go towards the payment of any additional loan amount I used. 
Now I'm getting conflicting information from Chase They say I owe XXXX for 30 years not 20. Since I took the 1st additional money off the equity Above my original loan I've been paying at least XXXX per month to go toward the loan amount I borrow so I've been paying that for 11 years additional. Every month Chase has been charging me XXXX or more at has not been applying anything to the amount of the additional equity borrow anything over the XXXX should have been credited towards the additional money I borrow. no credit has been issued to the additional money borrowed. somehow chase just increased my monthly payment by a {$100.00} For a few years now but has not applied anything to the extra money I've borrowed how can they do that When I spoke to representatives XXXX in the Chase branch in XXXX and we've been trying to get this rectified with chase home equity nobody has answers for me and respond they don't know what's going on just going by what we see. I've been requesting my originally signed papers the truth in lending, the mortgage papers As of this date they have not produced my originally signed papers. 
So my full complaint is how are they increasing my monthly payment Without putting nothing to the variable amount I borrow How do Chase increase my monthly payments from 20 to 30 years sounds illegal to me Where did all the extra money I've been pain according to WA ' mu would go to the variable I borrow .Where has it went where it is gone How come I Receive no credit For all these years I've been sending extra Money on top of my original payment. 
The billing statements are not clear on how much I owe on the variable amount or the amount left one say owe a XXXX total the other says i owe XXXX XXXX but how much did I borrow on the variable side there is no clarity. I'm trying to get clarity of all the figures but the Chase rep at home equity had no answers for me.

I want Chase to tell me how much I borrowed on the variable amount I want Chase to properly adjust and credit the amount of all the money I sent to creditors to variable loan over the years I want Chase to stop Billing meXXXX go back to my XXXX that I could choose what I wan na send an extra for the variable Get all my figures and have them all my monthly statements so I can see what's going on A monthly basis"

Mortgage,"This is an extension/addendum to complaint XXXX I have filed here and was closed by CFPB before its completed resolution. In essence, it seems that due to Chase Mortgage operational inefficiency and internal miscommunication between departments, the process completion of my mortgage loan recast case has been stuck in limbo since mid XXXX. Following are the specific details : 1. Ms. XXXX XXXX, a Home Lending Executive Office specialist, Ph. XXXX, ext. XXXX, was communicating with me by phone concerning my original complaint XXXX. She was my single and only contact, handling my case with the Recast Department, and updating me on my case status. ( Customers have no direct access to the Recast personnel. ) 2. The intended resolution stated on a letter Chase sent me on XX/XX/XXXX was that Chase will honor the recast agreement I executed with Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, which will reduce my mortgage payments from {$220.00} to {$200.00} retroactively, and credit/refund me the accumulated difference in payments. 
3. On XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX  back to Chase this XX/XX/XXXX letter with its enclosed Recast Acceptance Form as instructed. 
4. I alerted Ms. XXXX on one of our initial telephone conversations in XX/XX/XXXX that I will be leaving the country and my mail will be held from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, therefore all documents Chase requires me to execute must be delivered to my home address by XX/XX/XXXX, or by email after my departure date. Ms. XXXX assured me that the procedure will be done prior to my deadline, and I am to receive the new agreement by mail within a week. The first documents from Chase were actually Fedexed to me nearly a month later. 
5. I contacted Ms. XXXX upon receiving the letter with the acceptance form on or about XX/XX/XXXX to remind her about my overseas trip and to raise my concern about a second set of documents I expect the Recast Department to send me to complete this procedure, ( which I have previously required to execute on XX/XX/XXXX ). Ms. XXXX assured me there is no other documents to be sent to me, and that any further communications from Chase will be sent to my email address. 
6. My XXXX and XXXX mortgage statements have already been closed with no sign for the application of the recast terms. 
7. Two weeks ago, on XX/XX/XXXX, I left Ms. XXXX a voice message to let her know that Chase has not executed my recast terms yet, that she misinformed me about the process completion with the return of my Recast Acceptance Form, and that I am certain there is a second set of documents sent to me by Chase after my departure, which holds the process stuck in limbo until my return, and that I didn't receive any emails from Chase Mortgage or Recast departments.

There is a "" duplication of services '' that is in conflict and XXXX and Paypal need to develop a common ground for their transactions to prevent SELLER ABUSE! I'm not sure if the buyer took the necklace apart to steal the gold beads or what. I do know that it was as shown and pictures were submitted to show that fact! In my Auction is was stated that the item was SOLD AS IS and not returnable. This morning I woke up and Paypal has told the buyer that they could sent the item back which is broken and that they can get a refund. The buyer requested all sorts of additional shipping ( insurance and signature ) as well. According to the "" seller protection '' agreement that is attached I as the seller was protected so long as the "" payment was authorized '' and "" the item was sent '' which it was. My item was EXACTLY AS SHOWN AND DESCRIBED AND I SUBMITTED PICTURES TO XXXX PRIOR TO SHIPMENT. This was a final sale and the item is not mine, but this my claim since I listed, photographed and shipped it! I have attached pictures, showed where XXXX decided in my favor and the policies which say that Paypal has erroneously authorized a return. The contract is SOLD AS IS and this double jeopardy is not acceptable. The necklace had 14k beads and they purchaser could have broken the necklace to take them off or done any number of things to cause the breakage which are not the fault of the seller!"

Vehicle loan or lease,"In XX/XX/2018 we were referred to XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

The lease term was 48 months with a residual value of {$18000.00} and a 10,000 mile per year. Well before we drove the two hours to get to the dealership I submitted the online application and BOTH XXXX XXXX and Volkswagen Credit ran my credit report as a hard inquiry.

Then they ran hard credit inquiries three more times which by the end trashed my credit score and then came to me and told me because they could not "" verify my income '' and because I had so many hard inquiries the only way they could make the "" deal '' was to add an extra {$120.00} the the payment ( going from {$400.00} per month to {$520.00} ) and they would now require that I pay {$1200.00} up front and have a higher payment than what was promised. They also claimed that they could not verify that I had any previous car loans -- although I had a lease with XXXX   that was paid off early and still shows up in my Volkswagen online account. The other was an actual car loan through XXXX that was paid off in advance also. The series of lies were designed to increase the cost of the vehicle significantly -- {$6200.00} over the term of the lease. We were told our deposit would not be refunded if we did not complete the deal because they had taken the car out of stock and held it for us."

Checking or savings account,"Today, XXXX XXXX, XXXX I realized XXXX XXXX had withdrawn two {$5.00} fees for UNDELIVERABLE STATEMENT FEES on XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. 

My first complaint is that XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), Assistant Vice President, was very insolent and rude. She wouldn't even look or listen to me when I spoke to her. 

My second complaint is that XXXX XXXX with its faulty system is robbing people with their fees. XXXX dollars for UNDELIVERABLE STATEMENT FEE is a ridiculous amount. 

My third complaint is that I had on several occasions asked for the address to be updated and it was frustrating that it didn't get done when I first asked. I knew they weren't updating because I kept getting mail with the old address forwarded to me. 

My fourth complaint is that I had to ask the bank to close and delete my old checking account many times. I would go to the bank in person and ask the clerks to make these changes and they would say it was all taken care of but it wasn't. This ended up costing me money because online banking was set up to the old account with no funds automatically and when my bill pay would hit the lender would end up charging me for not having the money. 

Today, I stopped by the branch and spoke to clerk, XXXX XXXX, and he explained the fees were charged because the bank tried to deliver my statement and it was returned to sender. I explained to him that I have updated my address with the bank on several occasions and that I didn't understand why the statements couldn't be delivered. I told him that in the past I was charged a MAINTANENCE FEE of {$3.00} in XXXX for the months of XXXX through XXXX for getting paper statements instead of electronic. I'm certain I changed to electronic statements at that point and to support that, I can prove the fees stopped until this year but now with a different name. I also requested a refund for the fees. XXXX was very polite and attentive at all times and said he had to talk to his supervisor about the refunds so I waited for about ten minutes.

He returns to say he can only refund one {$5.00} fee and that their system showed one address update that took place in sometime in XXXX and that whoever made the change forgot to click something and the address in my savings account was not updated. Basically, it was a bank error that they didn't update my address and that they weren't sending electronic statements. I ask to see his supervisor. 

When XXXX XXXX finally came to talk to me, she was completely dismissive. I was trying to explain my situation and she was looking at the screen and started talking to XXXX while I was talking to her. She was not happy to refund me because she insisted I had only recently changed my address and wanted me proof of me changing my address before. She finally decided to give me a refund for {$10.00} and told XXXX in front of me and all the customers to add a note on my profile that if I had future complaints I wouldn't be refunded. In other words, I was black listed because I am rightfully asking the bank to give me back money that is mine. I was not asking for a hand out. 

This was the first time I asked for a refund for my money at this bank and I was treated with extreme contempt and disdain. 

XXXX XXXX advertises personal and friendly service, "" the kind of bank a customer can take home to meet their parents. The kind of bank that customer can be proud to introduce to all of their friends. '' This is false advertisement and they are trying to steal from their customers."
Student loan,"This is a copy of an email I sent to the servicer this morning XX/XX/XXXX : Good Morning, I am having a hard time understanding your practices when it comes to loan servicing. Information relayed between representatives to myself was not clear and concise. 

I changed my payment plan to be to a Graduated Repayment Plan on XX/XX/XXXX, notice of approval on XX/XX/XXXX with payment schedule attached. When I did this I was not told I was still under the umbrella of an IBR ( today was told this XX/XX/XXXX ) from XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that a part of my loans were out of deferment time, and payment would begin on XX/XX/XXXX. I was sent a letter saying my in-school deferment was approved ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and this was Moring was notified that my loan payments under IBR was increasing and my payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX to {$430.00}. Still nothing that there is a payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I want to know, how, with all the letters stating my payment are staring on XX/XX/XXXX, I have a payment past due on XX/XX/XXXX, the I was NEVER informed of. Then to have the representative tell me I need to have a forbearance to have this payment put on hold. I declined the forbearance because I should not have to do one when there shouldnt be a past due balance to begin with. The representative told me it will be corrected in the back office, with an advised date of XX/XX/XXXX, however, my payment will still show delinquent, until it is fixed from the back office. Then in XX/XX/XXXX I can resume my XX/XX/XXXX payment on the Graduated Extended Repayment Plan. The representative kept reiterating that they are two days past due, and no late charges or credit reporting has been done. This does nothing for me because there should not have been a payment due. 

I should not have had to go through this in the first place. This was ridiculous and an inconvenience. This needs to be fix ASAP. There is a disconnect in information and how it is processed. I have attached the e-correspondence pertaining to this situation. 

I look forward to your replay as to why this has happened."

Months later this Company purchased the debt from the original Collection Agency and then put it on my Credit reports. so I have been going back and forth trying to get this removed. its causing me stress and pain from getting approved for a Home. it was put on my reports XX/XX/2017.

Vehicle loan or lease,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I lost my job for more than 6 months with a young child, which caused my previous car to be repossessed. Therefore, when I got a job, it was far and I had to settle for a second chance auto loan lender, Credit Acceptance. I was told that I would be able to refinance the car to lower the interest rate but this never happened. No lender would refinance my vehicle because it has negative equity. I have had my car appraised, and it was estimated at being worth {$3500.00}, with me owing Credit Acceptance roughly {$14000.00}. No auto loan lender will refinance my current loan nor allow for a trade in with such a high loan balance. Essentially, i am stuck in this loan with a car that is fallen to pieces. The car does not shift gears properly without me using a screw driver, I am having transmission issues which have caused me roughly $ 2K to date, every time I have paid for my car door to be fixed it breaks again so I have roll down my window to open the door from the outside. My monthly payment is {$540.00} on this XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have asked Credit Acceptance to lower my interest to rate or lower my buyout so another auto lender can approve me to get another car and so that my roll over amount is lower. I have gone to 5 dealerships who have stated I am stuck in this loan and they can only assist me if my outstanding loan amount was roughly 50 % less. I think it is beyond ridiculous that second chance auto lenders are taking advantage of consumers who fall on rough times, where they have no programs to reduce interests or car appraisal for extreme cases such as myself. Additionally, they have poor customer service, where their customer service reps are beyond disrespectful and they call constantly when you have already agreed to a payment plan with another rep. I have also asked to speak to their legal department to try to come to a conclusion and they never called me back."

Vehicle loan or lease,"Purchased XXXX XXXX XXXX Boat HIN number XXXX XXXX   and XX/XX/XXXX Competitive Trailer License Plate number XXXX  Serial number XXXX  from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  CA XXXX  Purchase Date was XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  was the Lienholder On XX/XX/XXXX. I received a letter from Bank of America Bank of America became the new lienholder but they never notified the DMV that they had purchased my installment loan from XXXX XXXX. This provided the window of opportunity for the DMV employee to use to steal my boat and trailer.

The letter Bank lf America sent to me was to notify me that they had purchased my installment loan from XXXX XXXX for $ XXXX.and my paymsnts would go to them from that day fprth and to notify my insurance company, XXXX immediately that they were the new loss payee 's.

So, why didn't they secure my investmemt and make it a legally binding contract. Instead they created an obstacle that made it impossible for my worker 's compensation lawyer to locate the boats whereabouts and allow me the right to secure an alternate source of funding which is guaranteed to me by the law as part of due process. They sacraficed my equity by failing in their responsibility to me to keep the DMV informed.

My boat registration that was issued on XX/XX/XXXXremained current until XX/XX/XXXX. It still reflects XXXX XXXX in the lienholder position. How did they get me into court? And how can XXXX  Police male a statement such as the one they made referring to the boat being in the process of repossessio. How does one repossess something that is not even in their name? XXXX XXXX remained on title as lienholder through XX/XX/XXXX.when the boat was stolen. This created a huge problem. Bank of America had to go back to court six months after the boat vanished and show the court that the tranfsfer took place and then the bank had to go back to get the abstract of judgement against me as an individual Instead of my boat.

A DMV employee stored my boat and trailef at his property at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. When I went to pick up the boat on XX/XX/XXXX, it was gone. The DMV employee said the lienholder had picked [ t up.

This new information was revealed to me this year, XX/XX/XXXX. The DMV employee was arrested on '' XX/XX/XXXX. Case number XXXX. Arrest number XXXX Superior Court of California , County of XXXX. The XXXX agency was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The DMV who had been storing my boat and trailer XXXX XXXX XXXX was arrested for one count of Making a Perjerious Statement and three counts of Forged Instruments resulting in a conviction on one count of Forged Instruments. That day, my boat and trailer valued at {$32000.00} was not confinscated because XXXX XXXX had failed to notify the DMV that they no longer held a financial interest in the boat and trailer since they were paid off in XX/XX/XXXX as indicated by Bank of America 's letter to me from XX/XX/XXXX. Over five years earlier. The boat and trailer were left in the possession of this man, XXXX XXXX XXXX  who filed a false mechanics lien with DMV for {$3000.00}, claiming the lienholder chose not to pick up their collateral which is by no u certain terms what the bank told the police and the DMV on XX/XX/XXXX. I worked with DMV IA to have the lien removed from being processed but the boat vanished with new numbers on the hull.

A report from XXXX  Police eztablished that my boat trailer is in the possession of a man in XXXX named XXXX XXXX XXXX, still in my name, with the same license plate number, registered to an address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA with a forged release of liability allegedly signed by me. I never signed anything, nor was I notified of the {$3000.00} mechanic lien, XXXX XXXX XXXX 's arrest  or the boat trailer 's possession by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have researched him and he has several addresses on file for XXXX XXXX XXXX : : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA ; and very likely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Ca. Bank of America has a judgement in public record that is ruining my credit and due to the failure of both banks to be accountable for their shortcomings, criminally and civilly by my liss of due process and equal prorection of the law need to be made accountable. Bank of America got a judgement against me and collected tax credits by claiming my boat as lost when my boat has never been reported stolen or entered into the Stolen Vehicle/Vessel Recovery System and without ever having put themselves in the legal lienholder position on title with the DMV. My boat has a clear title and I expect it to be returned or compensate me for my loss of equity and the interuption of my pursuit of happiness for fourteen years. Bank of America 's stance of requiring a subpeona for me to access my own records through their Prote tive Intelligence Inveztigation Division is no more than what amounts to another civil violation : The Freedom of Information Act."

I was suppose to make an account and message her then I'm an applicant for the internship. I added her by looking up the email they sent me, "" XXXX ''. Then once she added me we began talking about the internship and the interview that is about to happen. She then sent me a list of questions regarding statistics, data and programming that seemed very specific, which added to the legitimacy. I answered all of them and moments later she told me I was accepted to the internship with XXXX XXXX XXXX. She then sent me a message that the contract will be emailed to me and that I am to send it back signed, the document they sent is attached below. After sending it back they started talking about training materials and how they're going to send the money to me and that I am to send it to a vendor that will purchase it. At this point I'm suspicious because it was all online and I didn't even talk to them through the phone yet, but I'm assured the internship is fine due to XXXX being a big and respectable company and the internship being found on it so they have to had checked and reviewed to see if the internship is legit. So they sent me a check for {$1800.00}, which is also attached below, and I mobile deposited it into my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account. Once I did it and it got returned, XXXX told me that the account they put the money in for that check was used to pay off other members. Then they asked me to use my Chase bank, once I got the new check for {$3800.00}, they told me to mobile deposited into my bank account, which I did. They then told me to wire transfer {$3400.00} to the vendor, which I did. Then later in the day, this was on XX/XX/2018. I got a message from Chase saying the check was fraudulent, the wire transfer was cancelled and that my account with Chase is in review. I messaged XXXX about it and she asked for my account number, I said that it isn't available due to my account being suspended.

Checking or savings account,"Complaint Details Within the past month US Bank has incorrectly charged me 13 overdraft fees for a total of {$460.00}. This began because I had placed a stop payment on a check for {$180.00} that US Bank allowed to go through. Since that transaction has gone through I have not been able to recover my account as I am on a tight budget as a single mother of XXXX. Because of these excess fees there is no way for me to get my account back on track and stop the overdraft fees from occurring. I had placed a stop payment on a check amount of {$180.00} that had correctly stopped one attempt at the check, however they allowed the payment to go 2 weeks later, causing my account to go continually into the negative. As a single mother of XXXX I am on a very strict budget so allowing that payment to go through created two weeks of continual overdrafts as most of my bills are set up to come out automatically. I called US Bank on numerous occasions and asked that they not allow transactions to go through if the funds were not there and was told that my account was set up to decline transactions where there was not funds, however this was NOT the case. There is absolutely no way to get my account back into the clear if they are continually charging these excessive fees. I was charged {$36.00} on a {$2.00} transaction. This is beyond excessive. I understand why the overdraft fees are set in place and would understand paying one. But 13? Over one check that should have never cleared in the first place? I have asked for US Bank 's assistance and they have declined"
Vehicle loan or lease,My vechile was totaled out by the at fault driver 's insurance company. My loan company was aware that the vechile was totaled out. My loan company has not or did not contact me at all since XX/XX/XXXX. I was in dispute with the insurance company so the insurance company contacted my loan company and lied stating that they the insurance company could not get in contact with me. I have attached screenshot showing communication after the date of when the loan company states they sent 10 day letter to the wrong address. So my loan company took the insurance companys side and put the unit out for reposession without any foundation. When I found the car repossessed I called the loan company and was not able to speak to the total loss department about the issue and also found out that the address that they sent the 10 day letter was the incorrect address. I have updated my address 3 months after I got the loan. My issue is that the loan company has never called me to inform me that the insurance company had contacted them and I know they have the correct number because I've had to open previous cases against this company due to numerous calls in one day several days in a row they have made. I was also informed that this is going to show as a reposession on my credit and it should not as it was a total loss and the company was aware of this.
Checking or savings account,"I saw Citi offering a bonus of {$400.00} for opening a savings account and depositing {$15000.00} for a minimum of 90 days. I created the account on XX/XX/XXXX, and deposited {$15000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX into the savings account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that I had earned the {$400.00} and it would be deposited within 30 days. On XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received the {$400.00} and called customer service. They indicated they would look into the matter and get back to me, but with no resolution. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire and they indicated they would resolve the issue in 5 business days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citi stating that they had investigated my case and that I was not eligible for the {$400.00} because the checking account had been closed, whereas the terms state the account must be in good standing. I thought the promotion was for a savings account and didn't realize the checking account had anything to do with this. The savings account was still open and in good standing with the required balance, and I had take no action to close the checking account. I called Citi customer service on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about this. They confirmed that I would not receive the bonus because the checking account had closed because of a XXXX  balance. 

This seems unethical because there is nothing in the main terms of the promotion that there must be activity in the checking account, only that there must be a minimum balance. I see that in the fine print of the promotion, it states that if you happen to deposit the full amount in one account but not the other, they will close the account and void the promotion. If I had simply moved a small amount to the checking account, I would have received the bonus. This does not seem fair, especially since they sent me an email on XX/XX/XXXX confirming that I would be receiving the bonus, even after the checking account had been automatically closed without any notice to me. This fine print term is clearly a misleading advertising tactic to XXXX their customers and does not seem like a fair term to include."
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"XXXX I spoke with a supervisor at Am/Ex and she informed me she would share my issues with my cartao in a complaint but no one would call me back or to follow up. 
This is a new cartao to me and I have two other cartaos with Am/Ex, since XXXX. I have a credit score over 800 and have all my cartao creditos on direct, full payment draft ... Except for this cartao credito, I have it set to draft {$500.00} on each due cycle. 
I was talked into taking this cartao over the phone by Am/Ex when I was communicating to them about one of my other cartaos. 
The short of it, they offered me a cartao with just minimum payment due until XXXX ; also if I spent {$5000.00} within the next 3 months I would receive XXXX in rewards points. 
Upon receiving the cartao, the first problem I noticed was the wrong DBA name on my cartao. 
It took until XXXX for them to correct this issue, I made NUMEROUS phone calls about this ( each time I was promised it would be changed and a new cartao would be sent to me ). Then when I was signing in online to make a minimum payment on this cartao, I could NOT do it as the ''primary cartao '' was a MUST to sign-in and I did not have that cartao, only had possession of an alternate cartao, XXXX XXXX ... This allowed charges to go onto the cartao and yet, American Express had NO WAY to allow me to go online and make a payment ( without the cartao with my full name, which Am/Ex had NOT even sent out until just before the bill was due ). 
I then went online ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and registered the cartao in my account with the help of Am/Ex, as each time I went to ''make a payment '' on the online service, under that cartao, the website of Am/Ex would ''flip '' me to a different cartao of mine! 
In other words, I would just about press send and then notice the screen reload and show a different cartao was going to receive that payment - which was {$200.00} ( which was greater than the minimum Am/Ex requested ). 
So, I went to an ''online chat session '' with Am/Ex and explained to them what was going on. While they were attempting to help me, perhaps they did fix something, as I was still attempting to make the payment as I was between the chat response times ... THEN, at one point, it took the payment of {$200.00} to the cartao which it was due, as I observed NO reloading of web page. 
I then moved on in conversation with the chat, to addressing my cartao having the wrong name on it and was informed a new cartao would arrive within 7-10 days, it arrived in XXXX! 
Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, I had another online chat session and was question why I was seeing a minimum payment due of {$5200.00} and I stated in the chat that this cartao did NOT have a interest until XXXX and why was I seeing interest charges. This person had a few more comments as I told him I could not verify my cartao because, the online ''visual request and showing me where security numbers were on the cartao, that this cartao did not have them! "" ... We went back and forth and then the Am/Ex representative put his supervisor on the chat. I offered to send the supervisor a photo of my cartao to prove to him no security codes was present as informed to locate. I also informed him of the cartao billing issues I was having and the amount of requested payment being wrong. 
This supervisor informed me that he was going to ''open a case '' "" Here is what I'll do for you, I'll go ahead and open a case on your account so that our team can look into the matter '' We then talked about what is going wrong with my account, he wanted me to call in to work it out and I wanted to resolve it in written form in the chat. 
He confirmed they were waiving the interest fee ( which I thought was in error all along as it was not as I understood the agreement ). 
I understood, only minimum payment due without interest and that they would extend the line of credit as I needed it. NEVER did I understand that anything above {$4000.00} would be required in FULL or I would pay interest and late fees on that amount. 
I contracted with Am/Ex over the phone with an agent that had trouble speaking or understanding English ; as I recall, I had to keep going over answers and issues with her. 
This is the chat Id XXXX from this XX/XX/XXXX conversation. 
Then we moved onto the problem with the cartao and how could we resolve my issues ( I have screenshots of the entire chat if needed ). 
This supervisor insisted that I call in and speak with someone ... I did that while he was still on the chat and ultimately discontinued the chat with this online chat representative. 
I was also confirming that the minimum we sent to come out each month went from {$200.00} to {$500.00} per month ( this was so I could knock down the balance before the XXXX interest due deadline ). Recall, I believed this cartao was NOT charging interest until XXXX! 
This is a quote I just saw from the live chat, "" Your introductory APR for new purchases posted to your account by XXXX is 0.00 % through your billing period ending in XXXX. After that, your APR will be a variable rate of the Prime Rate + 7.99 %, currently 13.24 %. '' This is how I understood this agreement and not how the last phone call I had with a supervisor explained it to me ... She informed me that, anything OVER {$4000.00} would be due in FULL or interest would be charged and a late fee! 
Please, locate that phone call records, as she informed me phone calls are recorded and told me I would have to take them to court to listen to them ( she said, this in an aggressive way, as the phone call will reveal ) ... 
If, you listen to the phone call, it will be revealed that Am/Ex ''set me up '' on this cartao ''deal ' that they ALWAYS had BAD INTENSIONS of ''suckering me '' into paying interest and penalty fees. That the limit they gave to me was {$4000.00} YET told me I would only have to make the minimum payment ( please find recordings of the agreement, when cartao was first agreed to ), at one point in contacting Am/Ex, after I realized that the ''numbers did not make sense '' ... That is, I had to spend {$5000.00} within 3 months but, I only had to make minimum payments on this cartao! They informed me, that the cartao does not have a limit and it is okay, and no interest until XXXX, please check the phone recordings during the time I made purchases from a landscape supply house ... that is when I was ''set at ease '' ... 
Fast forward to me and the late fees and I contacted them via chat today informing them that this cartao has to be fixed ( chat records exist ) ... Then going onto the supervisor on the phone and ONLY TODAY did I realize that anything above $ 4k I will owe in FULL or a later fee and interest would be charged! 
I informed the supervisor that American Express is running a scam, that if I made the minimum payment on $ XXXX ( cartao limit - which she verified to be {$40.00} per month ) and SO, if, I was to make the minimum payment ( as this cartao was promoted to me as, only minimum payment, no interest cartao ... ) that NO way could I EVER get the XXXX XXXX rewards points, as I would NOT be able to get to the minimum {$5000.00} in charges in 3 months WITHOUT going over the limit of {$4000.00} they gave me! 
ALSO, keep in mind, I have an 800 plus credit score! and I was totally shocked over the silly {$4000.00} limit the offered ... BUT, NOW it is clear why they did that, to cause this DRAMA and perhaps it works with a lot of people and maybe only one or two bite back ... 
I am biting back, as I am sure this cartao was set-up and offered to cause this issue. 
I have NOT to this day, received any written cartao requirements - all they sent me was a cartao on a glued paper ... 
I ask the help of CFPB to correct this error on Am/Ex part. 
Please, note, I did ask the supervisor to please give me further access to a higher level supervisor before I would make this complaint and she informed me that all she could give me was a an address in XXXX XXXX Texas to write and complain and that she was writing a formal complaint about my issues but that NO ONE would be contacting me about her written complaint. 
Further, NO ONE, has contacted me about any issues from the promised date, back in XX/XX/XXXX, ( the 6-8 weeks turn around time - has not happened as of yet ). 
This error put a hardship on me as it has caused me MANY hours of communicating with Am/Ex and only today I realized their ''scam '' ... I asked the supervisor tonight to simple allow my auto payment of {$500.00} per month to pay down the cartao in a timely manner and I would NO longer use the cartao as it did so. 
The supervisor said, she could remove the late fee and that was all. 
Again, this is not fair to me as consumer and I ask for your help."
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"I have a cartao credito with Bank of America. On XX/XX/2018, I identified two transactions that were fraudulent, both transacted through XXXX. Bank of America immediately removed them from my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America sent me a letter, indicating that they have decided the one transaction ( XX/XX/2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ, {$940.00} ), is NOT fraud, and put it back on my account. 

I spent at least 12 hours on the phone ( mostly on hold ) with Bank of America, and got extremely little transparency of how they made that decision. I ended up calling the vendor, who was very forthcoming and gave me the tracking info ( it  was a camera ). The tracking info shows that whoever committed the fraud has my address and had asked for it to be shipped to my address, but in talking to XXXX, the delivery was diverted to a XXXX center ( instead of my house ). It was picked up on XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX, in my name. This is impossible -- I faxed documents to Bank of America ( fraud fax number that was provided to me on one of my long calls ) that show I was on an airplane, flying for work to XXXX, at that time. I have both the invoice for that flight and the crediting of the flight to my mileage account ( which only happens once you have physically flown on the flight ). 

There is no way I could have picked it up. We, regrettably, do not even own a camera, and I did not place this order. 

I asked Bank of America, in that fax, to please confirm receipt of the flight information, which I have not received, and could not confirm after spending another 30 min on hold. At this point I am turning to you for assistance. I appreciate the help."
Student loan,"PAID OLD LOANS IN FULL, BUT THEY ARE STILL REPORTING NEGATIVE DESPITE BEING OVER 10+ YEARS OLD. HAVE FILED DISPUTE WITH CREDIT BUREAUS BUT WITH NO SUCCESS."
Vehicle loan or lease,"Hello, First of all, thank you in advance for your assistance and help.

Purchased a used SUV from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX with a cash down payment of {$10000.00} and a loan from the Bank for {$29000.00} which included an extended warranty $ 5,500+ ). 

After a careful reconsideration, we decided to cancel the extended warranty so visited the dealership on XX/XX/XXXX and told them to cancel the extended warranty and they agreed and assured me that they will cancel the warranty and refund the Bank. 

Almost 5 months later, on XX/XX/XXXX, while checking the balances online for the loan, I realized that there has not been a deduction of the $ amount for the cancelled extended warranty. So I called the Bank and explained my concerns and asked them if they had received any information regarding this matter from the dealership. The Bank had replied that they have never been informed as well as refunded and told me because the dealership had never refunded the money, I have been paying additional interest for the monies I did not have to. 

Tried several times for all day for two days to contact the dealership including the gentleman who had helped me with the loan and the sales manager without a luck.

This has been one of the most frustrating moments and experiences in my life and feel like I have been cheated. 

Please review my case and assist me in resolving this case. 

Thank you."
Checking or savings account,"I made cash & check deposit at my banks atm on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX, of {$43000.00}. I thought I had deposited {$500.00} in cash but I must have counted wrong because the receipt said {$400.00}. Thats my responsibility & my consequences to deal with. I received a call on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX by XXXX saying there was an issue with my name on the check, it was a settlement check from insurance of {$43000.00} I explained its my maiden name & a settlement from a loss that happened 3 yrs prior, she said that they were not going to accept the deposit because its made in my maiden name, i said ok & asked if i need to come pick up the check or do they mail it to me,. XXXX informed me because a mortage company was included on the check that it was sent to them. I then called my mortgage company and i spoke to a person whose name is XXXX & I explained to them they would be getting a check, why & what the check is for. for a claim that was years ago & that the bank for some reason had sent the check to them. she explained to me since i do not have any claims with my mortgage company the check will be deposited to my principal & I will need to request a refund, however she asked me to call the bank & ask what address did they send the check to. I called BB & t requesting to speak with the manager, I was told she was in a meeting & i could leave a message for her, in which i did, at XXXX XXXX @ BBT informed me the manager is in meetings all week & that she is the head teller & the manager asked her to handle this., I asked her the address the check was sent to? she told me that they have decided to accpet the check for deposit however because the check is in my Maiden name, she needs me to come into the bank with my license & docs to prove XXXX is my maiden name & also for me to sign an affidavit & that there will be an will increase on hold from XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I gathered all the docs, as well as docs from settlement to prove everything & more. The Next morning 30 mins prior to my appt time, XXXX called saying she has great news, she no longer needs all the proof of my name, that she had requested because they are going to accept the deposit However she needs something from my mortgage company endorsing the check. I did not realize the check needed to be endorsed by BOTH me & my mortgage company, as no other checks iv deposited have been. Why are they asking now? I thought the check was written out as AND/OR informed me i would need to open a claim, I explained it all to XXXX At BB & T bank & explained it would be a big deal, since it is a settlement and not an actual loss. I called XXXX repeated the conversation I had with XXXX @ mortgage company and that I would have to open a New claim with my mortgage & how XXXX said it is a big deal because i do not have a current loss, it requires contractors, etc. I told XXXX, again this is a settlement from a loss many years ago, i would be happy to show the papers to them proving all that i have said but that is all that I can do, there fore if that is a requirement to accept the check as a deposit, then it is fine that they do not accept it, and please return the check to me asap, this is delay that i can not afford. XXXX then told me, she would speak with HEADQUARTERS to let them know & that she would call me back to let me know and if not she would tell me when my check would be returned. explaining to my attorney what was happening, she said its simply only a formality that the Insurance is required to include the Mortgage on the check. That some banks require 2 signatures & some do not, especially given the fact that i am DEPOSITING the check in to my OWN account. I explained how i believed the check was written out as an and/or, she said if the check was lost she can request from the opposing counsil to make out the new check as such. Considering the settlement was over additional living, expenses, personal property & actual cost I expected that and/or is how the check was made out to begin with. I learned we could NOT in for a lost check, since THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN withdrawn for that check. XX/XX/XXXX I received a Text stating {$43000.00} posted to my account at BB & T also i recieved XXXX post letters in the mail stating my funds have cleared.with the date and times for partial release and remainder release. I recieve a call from XXXX states that she is the manager at Both the point loop branch as well as the XXXX branch telling me that they are withdrawing the funds from my account placing a HOLD on my account. for an inproperly endorsed check. I explained again everything i had been through with XXXX, reminding XXXX of who I am she knows my LEGAL name being Maiden XXXX married as XXXX, How long that I have banked with them of which she said she remembers me, and they dont want to accept my deposit over inproper endorsement, I again say it is fine I just want to know where is the check? when are they going to return it to me? How if its lost, i called to have a new one issued, but i was not able to because the funds have been withdrawn from the issuers bank. I dont know where my moiney is, that even my cash deposits have been put on hold all this time and its 10 days, she informs me that she put a hold on my account. I TOLD HER my kids can not have XXXX, my child support my cash is in that account, she states she will talk to XXXX and ask is advice and for me to call the branch on XXXX   XXXX tomorrow they may be able to give me some advice, I called XX/XX/XXXX as XXXX told me to I spoke with THE ASSISTANT manager she told me she was, I asked her if my deposit would be returned to me or who do I call that can help me with regulating banks, she began to ARGUE with me that I needed to wait until XX/XX/XXXX the hold would be removed and my money would be made available. on XX/XX/XXXX I recieved another call from XXXX at approx XXXX XXXX telling me I have to call the INSURANCE company have them to RECALL the check for inproper endorsement, and that after I do that and after they have recalled the check, only then they will release the hold on my account. I dont understand why BB & T does NOT acknowledge, that this was a suit and it was a settlement, I ONLY WANT my check returned. they treat me as if I DID SOMETHING WRONG. THEY REFUSE to RETURN the check to me & they WILL Not release the hold they placed on my account, my cash, my child support, they have all of my money, they have given me the run around, changed their story so many times, say they will accept then they wont accept the deposit which I have no issue with it but They DID NOT have a right to treat ME like I AM SOME KIND OF CRIMINAL.Their actions have made it so my children, my grand children DID NOT have a single gift, tree NOTHING we did NOT have XXXX. WHY is it taking all this time to simply RETURN MY Check? my cash? why IS MY ACCOUNT ON HOLD?

The property has been listed as a Short Sale for months now and I have had numerous loan offers from interested parties to buy the property. Loancare has been provided these offers all requested paperwork that they have asked for numerous times with no resolution or answer as to approving the short sale offers. They keep asking for documents and paper work that has been already provided and because of their delays we have had a previous offer fall through. Loancare has been very unreasonable since they have taken over my loan. They do not return phone calls left by our representation or emails and when they do they are weeks and months later.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a transfer online to send {$500.00} to my girlfriend in XXXX. I used the option to pull the money directly from my bank account rather than using my debit cartao because the fee was slightly cheaper. Total cost of {$510.00} was removed from my account. Using the tracking number we could see it was available for pickup. But when my girlfriend went to pick it up on XX/XX/XXXX she was denied and there was a hold on the transfer. 

I called Western Union and they told me they couldn't make the transfer. Then they said they could and gave me a new tracking number. But it also was denied when she went to pick it up. I called again and they said they would refund the money to me but that I had to pick it up myself. They gave me a another new tracking number. I told them I can't go to a western Union as I'm in XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. One rep said I could pick it up whenever I get to a location and one said it's available for 45 days. I am not and will not be near a western Union for who knows how long. Picking up the money is just not possible. 

I asked why they can't put the money back in my account the same way they took it out and they said it was because it was a cash transaction. I told them no I did it online. They still said I had to pick it up in person. I told them again where I am and that I can't go pick it up. I asked if my mom could pick it up but they said they can't change the transaction at all. 

On XX/XX/XXXX one customer service representative told me she could put in a request to transfer it into my bank but that it probably would not work. It didn't."

On XXXX the XXXX XXXX I wrote to XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked for Validation of the alleged debts they said I owed on five separate accounts. On the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX the read receipt was signed and sent back to me via USPS. No original documentation, signed paperwork, or anything they had on file pertaining to this account was sent as proof of validation and or verification of the alleged debt ; which was requested in my validation letter along with details of the debt, not just a monetary amount. I sent a 609 letter to XXXX  on XXXX the XXXX XXXX and they responded rather quickly ( XX/XX/XXXX I recieved my response ) having deleted 3 of the accounts ( that the Collection Agency didn't even mention in the return letter but I inquired about during first contact with my initial Validation letter ) but stated the two accounts listed in the  account had been verified and belonged to me. Again, the documentation I requested for proof of validation and what was used the verify said accounts were not given to me by the Credit Bureau either and by law I know I have the right to have valid proof that a debt is in fact my own otherwise it must be promptly deleted and all reporting should seize to any of the three major Credit Bureaus."

More than I originally agreed and with a new monthly due of over {$430.00}. What???? Nearly {$2000.00} in interest."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX we initiated 3 separate wire transfers to an account at Suntrust bank in the amounts of {$12000.00} {$16000.00} and {$20000.00}. The wire transfers listed XXXX XXXX XXXX as the beneficiary ( XXXX offices only exist in 2 states and Suntrust does not have branches in either one ) and the listed beneficiary did not match the account holders name. The money was intended to be for closing costs on a real estate transaction. One transfer completed on the XXXX and the other two completed on the morning of the XXXX. On the XXXX when we realized this was part of a wire fraud scheme our local sheriff department immediately reached out to the known contact he had at Suntrust ( he had the exact same situation occur a few weeks prior ). He was told at that time that all of the money was still in the account and a freeze was placed on the account. On Monday the XXXX we met with him and he called to verify that funds were still in the account but over the weekend they released almost XXXX of the XXXX that was sent. 

I called independently to ask what their policy was when a wire transfer was received that had a beneficiary that did not match the account holder and was informed their policy was to reject the transfer ( standard banking practice ). This clearly did not occur for the 3 separate transfers and all 3 were accepted. It is also worth mentioning that the account was newly established and with only {$100.00}. 

This event stems from someone emailing and pretending to be our closing agent. They actually provided me two separate Suntrust account numbers during the whole ordeal. I have since emailed that person and was provided with a third Suntrust account number. Including the first victim that is four total Suntrust account numbers. Clearly Suntrust has an issue and do not follow their own protocols that would protect themselves and their customers from being victims of these schemes. 

We have been told since XX/XX/XXXX that we would be receiving just under {$29000.00} back and that a check had been issued and would arrive by XX/XX/XXXX. The check has not been received."

Every year XXXX XXXX  XXXX collects the amount of {$140.00}, holds it in escrow to profit interest on it then sends it to XXXX County. And each of the past four years XXXX XXXX XXXX told me to go make XXXX County give me the money back. USAA and XXXX XXXX XXXX are taking my ( possibly many others ) property tax, holding it for investment, making money on it, then paying tax that is not to be paid. This practice needs to stop.

Student loan,I have several loans in ibr with Navient. I was told that two of my loans do not qualify for Ibr and wont be part of the ibr forgiveness in 25 years because my income is too high. My loans  are also split up and being paid off in increments instead of a whole. So some of them will likely get paid off before the 25 year mark instead of the entire debt being forgiven at 25 years. Until I spoke to the customer service I had no idea that it was not counted as part of my total debt and to the IBR calculation

cdb,"XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern : In XX/XX/XXXX, I had XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a result of these medical bills and my inability to pay them ( while trying to prevent the spread of the XXXX ), I was unable to pay the portion not covered by my health insurance. This ultimately went into collections with TransWorld Systems , Inc. 

I was contacted by TransWorld Systems in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/2018 and made financial arrangements to pay $ XXXX/month ( which has been paid as agreed through automatic debit ). I was told by the agent setting up the arrangement that as long as this was paid as agreed, there would be no further reports to the credit bureaus. 

All was fine until XX/XX/XXXX when I received a credit monitoring alert that TransWorld had sent my info as a negative to the credit reporting agencies. When I contacted TransWorld, not only were they rude and told me I should have paid my bills on time and it wouldnt have gone to collections, but they also gave me the run-around and said they did not report this and that I needed to contact the hospital ( XXXX   Hospital Center ). After numerous run-arounds with both entities, I ultimately contacted TransWorld again and they said it was indeed them that had reported it. I asked why and why now because everything had been fine since XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/2018. They had no explanation. 

In addition, Id received a collection call from TransWorld on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked why was I receiving this call when arrangements were already made? After looking again at their records, they verified that arrangements were made but that the call was a clerical error and that I was fine and nothing further needed to be done on my part because my pre-arranged information/payment plan was in the system. 

As a consumer and someone dealing with a health issue, I have rights that this collections agency doesnt seem to care about. They have the upper-hand with consumers and this is wrong. I made arrangements and have been paying as I agreed but yet they still report me and ruin my credit that I have worked hard to build. I can not help that I had a health crisis. I could understand if I hadnt or havent been paying as agreed but I have and they dont care about me, all they care about is getting their money. As a resolution, I will pay my debt ( that isnt the issue at all ), I just want the negative impact removed from my credit. It is my understanding that the collections agency has the ability to do this.

Student loan,"I learned recently about the TEPSLF opportunity looking at the news. So I started researching this program and found out that it was temporary. This lead me to research the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. After doing much research, I saw that in order to qualify for this  program I had to be in an income-based repayment plan. I've taken a forbearnace for the last 3 years. Every year I called, the XXXX XXXX representatives NEVER informed me that instead of taking a forbearance that I actually could of entered into an income drive repayment plan and get a much lower monthly payment that would've been counted as a qualifying payment under the PSLF program. I am still having financial hardship and I have no other options as I have now exhausted my forbearance and I have no choice but to pay a very high monthly payment! I felt that the representatives I spoke to over the years did not have enough knowledge about repayment options and lack training. This really saddens me as now I can't go back in time and I'm stuck due to XXXX XXXX incompetent staff."

Also, I have in the past been harassed by Sallie Mae operators being told what I WILL do or else. I've had them yell at me and threaten my co signer. 

I have asked repeatedly for income based repayments but they don't exist I guess. 

These loans are very difficult to afford every month and now my protections are not available because they pushed me into using them up."

Vehicle loan or lease,"Credit Acceptance does NOT have a CDCA license in Pennsylvania and therefore legally can not charge 21 % daily simple interest rate in PA.

Ann. 6203 A lender who wishes to make loans in amounts less than {$25000.00} with interest rates greater than 6 % must be licensed under the CDCA. A licensed lender may make loans that are greater than the rate specified in the maximum interest rate law. ( 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. 6203. ). in the state of Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania has two usury statutes that govern the maximum interest rates that lenders may charge in the state : 1. The Loan Interest and Protection Law ( maximum interest rate law ) ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 201 ).

2. The Pennsylvania Corrupt Organizations Act ( 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. 911 ( h ) ( 1 ) ( iv ) ). In addition, the Consumer Discount Company Act ( CDCA ) requires individuals who wish to make loans of {$25000.00} or less at interest rates higher than 6 % to obtain a license ( 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. 6203 ).

The Pennsylvania Attorney General ( PA AG ) enforces the maximum interest rate statute and the Pennsylvania Corrupt Organizations Statute ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 506 ; 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. 911 ( e ) ). The Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities enforces the maximum interest rate statute and the CDCA ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 506 ; 7 Pa. Stat. Ann. 6212 ).

Maximum Interest Rate Law : 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 201 Lenders can not charge an annual interest rate greater than 6 % on consumer loans that are : 1. {$50000.00} or less, for secured and collateralized loans.

2. {$35000.00} or less for unsecured and non-collateralized loans. ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 201. ) The 6 % usury rate does not apply to : Business loans ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 201 ( b ) ). Residential mortgage loans ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 301 ).

A lender that violates this law : o May be required to pay a {$10000.00} fine for each offense ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 505 ( b ) ).

o May face a civil action from the borrower and be required to pay the borrower : three times the amount of the excess interest and charges ( 41 Pa. Stat. Ann. 502 ) ; and attorneys ' fees ( 41 Pa.

I was told they are "" A second chance loan '' and basically I do not have the same rights as any other civilian who took a "" normal '' loan. I feel that Credit Acceptance preys on consumers trying to restore their credit. They state on their website that 52 % of borrowers are a "" sublime '' loan group. Hence, they did their research and clearly created a product to lock you in not caring that the vehicles that fall under this program are high mileage and old. The dealer that i bought vehicle thru closed within a week after purchase. Even though he told me my interest was 16.5 %, and after a year I could refinance, and that I could also make extra payments a month to put directly onto principal. This is all denied by Credit Acceptance. I believe the dealer lied to me to make the sale because they knew they were closing and could careless. Granted this is about Credit Acceptance, they are illegally charging high interest rate loans in a deplorable manor.

I contacted Bank of America on XX/XX/18 and first spoke with XXXX in regards to the fee, and asked to speak to a manager to have that fee reversed, since there are transactions still in process and I should not be charged an overdraft fee in advance for transactions not completed. Also, since I never signed for overdraft protection, any transaction that comes to my account when there is no sufficient funds should be declined.I explained to her that I was being charged by Bank of America an overdraft fee for transactions not yet posted to my account. She did not transfer me to a manager or  supervisor and started to give me an education session over the phone. I disconnected the call and called Bank of America again and was connected with a representative named XXXX, who said he is a manager in West Virginia. Mr. XXXX also wasted a lot of my time and at the end, refused to reverse the {$35.00} fee.

The issue here -- besides still not receiving that money, is that PayPal seems to think it's okay to have one phone number for multiple accounts. If the phone number is the only account-identifying recipient information needed, the security of that money transfer is questionable.

Which account holder will receive the money?

Since this incident, I have spent several hours on the phone with them, and actually won a reversal of the {$500.00}, only to have that reversal rejected by their fraud team. Attempts to speak with their fraud team have resulted in being placed on hold for hours at a time.

The sender has had less success trying to mitigate this than I have."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","For the second time this year Paypal allowed a stolen debit cartao of mine to be used for fraudulent transactions. 

One time is understandable, but twice is either negligence or policy. 

I was notified by my bank on XX/XX/XXXX that my cartao was used via paypal twice for {$100.00} each. There were several more attempts made but they were able to block the use of the cartao. 

I contacted paypal regarding the issue and they claimed the cartao was swiped in XXXX ohio for the transactions and they would not refund the charges. 

I was not in XXXX ohio on the XXXX and have not been there for over 20 years and the cartao was never out of my possession. 

They basically said I was lying and they would not do anything about the charges. 

Like I stated above back in XXXX of this year they stole {$1300.00} from me and took over 2 weeks to give it back. Since I dont have a paypal account they were more worried about their customer being upset than the money they stole from me. 

Again, I have the cartao, it nor I was ever in XXXX. They continue to show that they make money off of the fraudulent charges and they dont care that non customer victims are being screwed by their incompetence. 

Here are the details of the transactions : cartao # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX DEBIT cartao PURCHASE OUTSTAND AUTH XX/XX/XXXX XXXX as XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( Cash ) - {$100.00} Processing DEBIT cartao PURCHASE OUTSTAND AUTH XX/XX/XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX ( Cash ) Amount - {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX DEBIT cartao PURCHASE OUTSTAND AUTH XX/XX/XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX ( Cash ) - {$100.00} Processing DEBIT cartao PURCHASE OUTSTAND AUTH XX/XX/XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX ( Cash ) Amount - {$100.00}"
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"On XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted a complaint against Citibank for reporting erroneous information about our cartao credito account. 

The issue is this : In late XXXX, XXXX we received correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the above referenced Citi Mastercartao. In a subsequent phone conversation, we explained to XXXX that we had : Never received any statements from Citibank about the account ending in XXXX. 
Had never used the cartao credito Felt that this was somehow related to fraudulent activity that had occurred on a Citi Mastercartao account ending in XXXX. 

At that time, we requested that XXXX provide us with Citi Mastercartao account statements so that we could review the activity. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received 12 months of back statements from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. After a review of the information, we feel that the charges are fraudulent, as we had informed Citibank and the late fees and interest accrued unjustified. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX of Citibank 's Executive Response Unit stating that we were correct and that all late fees and interest charges were waived. I contacted Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that there was an outstanding balance of {$7.00} on the account but the balance was not past due. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX stating the citibank had once more reported this account as past due. I have contacted Citibank once more and received no cooperation in resolving this issue."
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"Im writing to complain about Bank of America cartao credito company. I am a cartao holder with Bank of America specifically XXXX XXXX Mastercartao. On XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018 had unauthorized charges totally over 8k. My XXXX  child snuck my cartao credito and wrote down the information on a piece of paper and began to charge over 30 times to a fraudulant company with out my authorization. At one point the cartao credito transaction exceeded beyond the credit limit by about 2k. Yet Bank of America continued to let these charges go through with out putting a fraud alert and stop to further use of access. On XX/XX/2018 when i noticed the unauthorized charges I immediately contacted the Bank of America fraud department while the the charges were still pending. I explained that I did not authorize these charges and the situation. Some but not all the unauthorized transactions were disputed and was given a credit of {$6600.00}. I called back the next day to inform them they did not include all the charges. They said they would and it never happened. I get a phone call from a fraud representative on XX/XX/2018 stating that my fraud investigation would be closed and all the credits applied would be reinstated. I asked why the representive told me because it was someone I knew and my own child that it was not fraud. I explained that i read my terms and condtions of my cartao credito and have a {$0.00} dollar liability towards any unauthorized transactions. The representative then hung up on me. I called back to speak with another representive about the situation and explained I thoroughly reads my terms and conditions of my credit contract and that my {$0.00} dollar unauthorized transaction does not exclude anyone including minor children or whom i know. I did not give authorazition for any of the transactions and that Bank of America was violating my terms and conditions of our cartao credito agreement. The federal trade commission anda states I am not liable for any unauthorized transactions and it does not exclude anyone. I reported the activity in a timely matter. I also explained that as a cartao holder i have very limited history of spending period and that based on the excessive charges and amounts to the same merchant and within a very small window time frame to include going over the limit which I never have, they should have protected my account security and done something to prevent this to where it wasnt exacerbated to this extent. As of XX/XX/2018 my fraud claim is closed. I have been charged back the unauthorized charges and Bank of America has not written me a letter of explanation. Although it says in the message center to see attached letter there is none. My account has always been in good standing and being over the limit on my cartao credito negatively affects my credit score and rating. Once again i did not authorize the charges."
Student loan,"When it came time to repay my student loan I was not sure of the best value. Between the provided tool and my financial planner I decided on the extended fixed payment plan, with a payment of {$600.00} ( adding {$60.00} extra ) for a term of 20 years. I made sure to do direct deposit for the 0.25 % savings and the ease of setting/forgetting. In XX/XX/2017 I received a notice that an Income-Driven Repayment Plan was approved. Having been told I was ineligible for that option due to my income I let that slide - had to be an error. When a paper slip mentioned a bill of {$0.00} I complained to the XXXX customer service - received no help, was told that I obviously put the change there ( when I had not ), never mind there being no income to draw from to make an IDP estimate. Frustrated I decided to continue paying $ XXXX/month in spite of having XXXX balance bills so that I would not be behind on my payments. In XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX I got a notice that my IDP was set to expire. By the end of XX/XX/XXXX (XX/XX/XXXX ) when it expired my payment went to $ XXXX/month with the added {$60.00}. Panicked I signed up for the IDP before remembering that I wanted the Extended Fixed Plan. The same evening I signed up for the Extended Fixed Payments plan. Seeing no movement I applied for that plan again. Now the XXXX program wants me to pay $ XXXX/month even after I've put in paperwork months prior to change my repayment options."

They didn't notify me of the findings days after. They just sent me a letter for a survey of the dispute that was already closed. I contacted amex to see the ending of dispute and they said it was on flight company 's favor. I called flight company and they said. They said my tickets were canceled due to amex saying transaction was not recognized ( I never said I did not recognize transaction [ i only wanted to cancel 1 ticket ] ) I called amex and they said they needed proof it was cancelled. Finally I got proof the whole transaction was canceled {$790.00} flight company sent me a letter. Amex made me write down additional letter with details. I did and included letter from flight company that states the transaction was canceled and still amex went ahead and charge me for that transaction that had been canceled. They are still charging me {$790.00} and they refused to solve my problem ignoring the fact that transaction was cancelled a month before "" departure date '' and even flight company sent me a letter, Which was originally requested by amex and now still amex is charging me for a service that was completely cancelled."
Student loan,"In 2017 American Education Services applied my daughter 's payments ( I am the cosigner ) to the wrong loan. Upon receiving notices of delinquency, both my daughter and I repeatedly called AES, and were told that the payments had been corrected and that the notices of delinqency were a mistake. It continued to be a problem, but they continued to tell us that the payments were being correctly applied. Subsequently, the loan was placed in default and sent to collections. Attached are documents clearly showing that the last payment on the loan prior to it being declared in default was made on XX/XX/2017 in the amount of {$130.00}. Also attached is a letter from AES dated XX/XX/2017 stating that the payment is 149 days delinquent, which was clearly not the case. My daughter, and I, again contacted AES, but it was by then placed in default, and they refused to even discuss the matter. Presently, the loan is in collections with a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX, I was provided a {$5000.00} from XXXX XXXX aka XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The term 24-month title loan with a {$1800.00} finance charge - total repayment should have been {$6800.00}. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the loan off completely total payments were {$6600.00}. I was provided a {$200.00} credit for paying it off 20 months early. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage officer stated I had an open car loan with the above company with a balance of {$2900.00} and monthly payment of {$370.00}. 

Since I had paid that loan in-full, I knew this was an error and called the company immediately. They informed me that I had purchased {$1500.00} additional service package when I received the loan. They stated there was nothing they could do for me and that I must pay. 

Please note, the day I received the loan was I was in a jam and needed the money quickly to repair my truck for work. The contract they provided was in English and since I don't read English well I had to rely on the honesty of the companies representative. 

Unfortunately for me he was not honest.. Since this {$1500.00} package was never mentioned. I recently found out they have a common practice of selling you additional services with providing full disclosure. 

The finance charges XXXX XXXX are charging should be illegal. But I would have never complained, because they lent me the money when I needed it. 

They purposely provided me a contract that they knew I could not understand and did not disclose the additional fee. This practice is extremely deceitful and should be illegal. ( My daughter is translating this letter for me ) Sadly for me and my family we are about to lose the opportunity to purchase a home because they are trying to swindle us out of an additional {$2900.00}."
Checking or savings account,I contacted US Bank on XX/XX/XXXXabout unauthorized transactions on my account and was told there was nothing they could do about them because I was at the establishment and I have to wait for them to post. I looked at my account this morning and I have an overdraft fee. I called and I wanted an explanation and I was told that the transactions from XX/XX/XXXX brought the account negative which is not true. US Bank is attempting to pre charge me a fee on an authorization that is fraudulent and not authorized. This is bad for business. I was not advocated for as a customer. US Bank looked for a way to profit from my loss. This is very distasteful. I asked to speak to a manager and it was refused.
cartao credito or prepaid cartao,"For the last few months, I have been making payments of $ XXXX- {$35.00} OVER the minimum payment in order to reduce the cash advance balance, which has a higher interest rate. For example, my minimum payment in XXXX was {$54.00} but I paid {$85.00}. The purchase balance was {$60.00} at 15.99 % and the cash advance balance was {$1900.00} at 20.99 % interest. I did make one purchase  on this cartao last month in the amount of {$20.00}. I received my new statement today. My purchase balance went down to {$29.00} and my cash advance balance went up to {$1900.00}. I thought that payments made over the minimum balance were required to be credited to the higher interest balance first, but it isn't happening. I contacted Chase last month about the same issue, because I again paid {$27.00} over the minimum payment in XXXX, with XXXX purchase of {$24.00}, yet my purchase balance dropped to {$60.00} and my cash advance balance increased from {$1900.00} to {$1900.00}. They claim that they are applying my payments properly, but I disagree. Isn't it illegal to apply extra payments to the LOWER interest rate balance first?"

A complain is already opened for them to adjust to 4 % instead of 5.62 % because they assumed it was a clerical error.

After completing the sale I called Coinbase support immediately per the instruction on their website which specifically stipulate it takes 48hours to have your seed key reissued. After sitting omn hold for two hours I spoke to a representative in the Coinbase customer support center and was assured my issue would be escalated. 


The primary problem I faced and need to access my account was the bank account on file was no longer valid anf needed to be updated. The way Coinbase works is upon a sale your money will transfer to the bank account on file within 4 business days. In. theory I had plenty of time to fix the proble XX/XX/XXXX fell on a Friday and the following Monday was XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore my money would not transfer until Thursday. On Tuesday after not having received any notice to update with the seed key reset, I called Coinbase back to express my concern and they hung up the phone on. me. I called back and they were rude once more and hung up again. I called back a third time and expressed I had already been the victim of ID theft and was afraid that not having specialist fix my problem would expose me to more fraud. and loss they hung up on me again and XXXX me they had "" ESCALATED '' the case to a specialist. 
acc On XX/XX/XXXX the Wednesday after mh sale I found my XXXX   and was able to access my account. I proceeded to update my banking info with out an issue. And confirmed why account per the Coinbase protocol and deleted the old one. I then called hem back to confirm and was told my transfer to my bank would happen the next morning n as planned anf be directed into the new account .... 

The Next morning nothing was wired to me so I called Coinbase back and spoke to support. while on the phone with support I saw my Coinbase balance had been sent somewhere, since the customer support team is unable to help in any many other then telling me they would escalate my case my entire account had been cleaed. out. That day and into the next morning, I watched as my account was used to purchase and transfer another XXXX, from my checking account into coinbase to effect more purchases orf BtC and transfers that were not authorized or executed by me .... 

I called coinbase back and told them my account was hacked on their end and that they had stolen XXXX additional dollars from my checking account ... THEY DID NOTHING AS THEY SAID DID NOT LOC K MY ACCOUNT DOWN..

I called Discover because I could not make that large of a payment, but I did make what I thought should have been my monthly payment of {$540.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I didn't realized at that time that the company did not apply my first payment correctly, so I asked if I could skip remaining payment for the month of XXXX. They agreed for me to skip the remaining XXXX payment and have the cost added to my monthly payments for a year starting in XXXX. However, when I next checked how much was due, the total number reflected both the XXXX and XXXX payment, as well as the increased payment for XXXX ... all due in XX/XX/XXXX. I called Discover back and on this second call, they realized they had never applied my XXXX or XXXX payments of {$540.00} correctly towards the principle. At this time, they removed the payment plan I had set up to start in XXXX and told me they would apply my XXXX and XXXX payments correctly so that I would simply owe another {$540.00} in XXXX. The Discover representative apologized and told me he would submit a report to Discover 's headquarters about the incident. Today I called Discover back again after seeing that nothing was fixed and they now wanted {$1600.00}.

Suddenly cartao did not work, so when I called, and was told there may be fraud on account, but can not tell me the charges, nor could I go online anymore to verify my account and charges. I told them I have a credit score of XXXX and want to make sure they do not charge late fees or report my account late if I can not go online, have no statements nor can they verbally verify purchases. Nor did they contact me in any form that there were possible fraud charges. I called them when the cartao didn't work. They said they had to authenticate me, so I went to a website under their direction, did a video and took a picture of my drivers license, they asked me my date of birth, address and SS # and after all that and 1 hour later, said, oh, we can't verify you, but I could make a payment over the phone. I said make a payment to what?! What are the charges? Still they couldn't tell me the charges. Then they said I could send my drivers license and social security care to a PO box . Geez! Really? I asked for a physical address and was going to send it registered mail receipt requested. I have sent in before my drivers licences but they have not taken care of. Now they have my drivers license and a video but still that was not good enough. Just make a payment to some random charges that may or may not be mine! What difference will it be that I sent my drivers license electronically and then the mail 3 previous times and now a copy of my social security cartao! They worry about fraud and security but send a copy of my drivers license and social security cartao through the mail to a PO Box . Now does that make senses? Also, it is illegal to ask for monies for something the consumer is unaware of what the charges are for, this is extortion. They are holding my good credit reputation hostage and pay up or else ...

I want my account unblocked to review the charges, or get a statement of the charges, or verbally be told what the charges are for, then once I verify I will pay for what I am responsible for, pretty simple. But have been on the phone 2 days, recorded calls"
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I have opened a Coinbase account last year and had go through a few transactions before it was unabled. Previously, I still able to withdraw, deposit and buy from the account. However, since last XX/XX/2017, I faced this issue for not able to do anything with the account such as buying, withdrawing and depositing. I just want the money to be out from that account so that I could pay for my expenses. I have contacted Coinbase support team so many times, and they told me to wait until the Specialist looked over my case. They even say I was at the highest priority level but until today, they still have not solve my issue. I also saw many comments about the same issue in XXXX and have posted my issue there. Also, I sent several personal message to the coinbase staff through XXXX since they did replied to some of the comments in the post. Unfortunately, no one response to me. This issue has been up for more than 5 months since last year and I really want it to be solve."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2018 Trump signed into law exempting certain banks from CFPB regulations. On XX/XX/2018 I got my first fee ... my bank, Key Bank, began charging "" maintenance service charge '' of {$18.00} each. They also charged me a "" foreign transaction fee, '' and told me it was due to buying something outside the country ... which I have done many times for baking or jewelry supplies. These are fees I have not had on that checking account since opened 10 years ago and nothing has changed with my use of the account. 

Fees appeared on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX - {$18.00} - maintenance service charge XX/XX/XXXX - {$18.00} - maintenance service charge XX/XX/XXXX - {$0.00} - foreign transaction fee XX/XX/XXXX - {$18.00} - maintenance service charge Before XX/XX/2018,"
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","This person was selling football tickets online so I reached out via email and later by texts. The person requested to use XXXX for payment which is associated with my XXXX quickpay so I felt safe to do so. but that person never sent the tickets nor responded, phone Shut off, which I realized it was a scam. I IMMEDIATELY contact XXXX but was told they couldnt cancel or stop the payment from my account as it was an instant transfer even though it was a Sunday the money was still showing pending. so I called again early next day to report a claim, so far the money has not been refunded to me and I received a mail from XXXX saying the transaction is valid."
Student loan,"I am so distraught ( again ) about the conversation I had with XXXX XXXX. There has not been a single helpful conversation. I decided to go to school and pursue my XXXX 's and do everything I needed to do to effectively start my payments, paperwork, certifications, applications, etc. I pay my bill at the exact time every month. And yet, it is still the most difficult devastating process I have ever had to ( consistently ) deal with. I just received a letter in the mail saying that my rebate has been disqualified due to a late payment, which was dated over a year ago. The payment they are saying is late I was told over and over that it was taken care of and would not be considered late because I had been on the phone with them multiple frustrating times trying to get my loans transferred over to them from XXXX, having to submit an application that they never received because none of my paperwork transferred over, so I had to resubmit everything! Then to have more notifications saying it was denied, which gave no reason, so I had to call AGAIN. I had to submit my loan payment application, my IBR application, and my PSLF application and nothing was complete on there end and they said it could take up to 2 weeks or so just to be reviewed. In the meantime, they told me that they would submit a forbearance because I didn't want my payment to be considered late. Even after that month forbearance, they still didn't have everything completed, so my payment was extremely high, and they told me to wait and the payment wouldn't be considered late. I was told in XX/XX/XXXX that my payment would NOT be considered late. Over a year later ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I receive a random letter in the mail that says my Direct Loan Rebate is Disqualified due to a late payment ( that same one they told me was taken care of ), and there's NOTHING they can do about the rebate now. I am APPAULED and SO Distraught how much stress and frustration that working with them has caused and I get absolutely nowhere, even when I speak to a supervisor. Even more frustrating, when they were reviewing the notes in their system, they spoke as it was so simple and 100 % my fault that the payment was late. I want action taken against this horrendous company, and don't understand how they are still allowed to exist, knowing that I am by far not the only person that this has happened to! I want to take any and every action I can against them because this has been the absolute WORST experience in my LIFE, and makes me regret making the decision to go to college thinking it would be best for me and my future. I regret it completely when it comes to trying so hard to deal with XXXX XXXX! I am SICK! 

I have the documentation that I have received through my portal, but unfortunately, everything has been by phone conversation so I have NOTHING to refer to besides these horrible memories ... The few times I did try to resolve things over email, my email kept getting passed around to different people every time I would reply which got me absolutely nowhere so I had no choice but to call again. This is COMPLETELY HORRIBLE!"
Checking or savings account,I opened my new checking account with Citi Bank in XX/XX/2018 and met the requirements for the promotion offer of XXXX . It has been more than 6 months and I have not received any bonus. I called the customer service several times in the past few months but no any response. I request the Citi honor its promotion offer as advertised.
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","My new boss sends me a Cashiers check Monday XX/XX/XXXX telling me to deposit in my account. I deposited the check and she was very suspicious about it, asking me if imthe check cleared every 5 minutes. I called Chase bank customer service and spoke with a person in XXXX to double check that everything was right with the check. My understanding is that if something is wrong with the check, the bank is the only entity that can tell me whats going on. I tell her the story and that I thought it was a fake check and she said youre fine cause the check cleared and it was a cashiers check. In order to have one of those you have to pay cash so youre fine that was at XXXX Tuesday morning. At XXXX my boss tells me to withdraw XXXX and deposited in a XXXX XXXX account to pay for some bills, since the bank told me that everything was fine I did it and I said to myself youre probably overreacting, the bank already told you that it was fine after that she asked the for a {$200.00} XXXX XXXX and I sent it as well. By XXXX my account was negative {$3400.00} ( the amount of the check was {$3900.00} ) I called my boss and she blocked me. When I called the bank they told me that it was my fault that I should be more careful next time. I filled a complaint at the police department and called the Chae complaint department yesterday and honestly, no one really helped.The last person told me I was a scam victim and that she was sorry for the misunderstanding with the customer service rep but I needed to pay that amount by XX/XX/XXXX cause after that a debt collector was going to contact me. In conclusion, I called the bank before doing everything else, the rep told me that it was okay. When it comes to my Chase account I only trust Chase customer service. I dont work for them, they should know better!! I need them to find that conversation and deal with the situation. A miscommunication in that magnitude ruined my life basically. Now I owe almost {$4000.00} that obviously I dont have just because I trusted a Chase customer representative that didnt know what she was saying/ doing. Im really disappointed and a little scared of the situation. And at this point I believe theyre not going to help me get to the bottom of this."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I contacted PayPal XX/XX/XXXX and communicated with them throughout the morning on my request to have fees totaling {$61.00} returned to me. They are unfairly charging me a fee for requesting money from a close friend paying me rent. Where I used to have the option when requesting money to select friend/family or goods/service, I no longer have that option. Instead, I can only request the funds, with no disclosure that a fee will be accessed based on what the payer selects when they approve my request. Further, on the payer end paypal has admitted to me that it defaults to good or service, as opposed to prompting the payee to select. This results in the payee, if quickly trying to submit a payment, to be unaware they have more then one option. Their only solution is to return the funds to the original payee and have them resubmit the transaction. Further their final communication with me told me they would not be refunding the fees and they have failed to acknowledge the disclosure issue. PayPal should be allowing the requester to select if its friend/family or good/service and the payee to approve or deny before sending the funds. In addition, PayPal used to give the option for the requester to select friend or family but changed it without sending out proper notification to customers and then referred me to a different site to read about it. And finally, I had to send screenshots to representatives to prove that you could not select friend/family on the requester side because they weren't aware the option wasn't available to customers. Simply put, PayPal needs to have disclosures that the consumer can agree to before submitting. Even if they had a disclosure that said "" a fee could be charged based on the options selected by the payee '' that would alert the requester would be sufficient."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",My loan payments were always sent on time. I keep explaining this to Experian but they keep on saying that the accounts are accurately reported and they have verified it. The accounts were not reported correctly and I would like it fixed. Please CFPB step up and correct the status because I was never late on my XXXX XXXX XXXX DE
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","During a recent review of my credit report, I noticed a credit inquiry by XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/18 that I did not recognize. I contacted the company via certified mail which was signed and received by the company on XX/XX/18. The company replied back on XX/XX/18 reporting that they received an application for credit from XXXX by XXXX and verified the credit inquiry. I sent a second letter via certified mail to XXXX XXXX that was signed and received by the company on XX/XX/18. In the second letter, I again disputed the inquiry and requested their verification procedure. To date ( more than 60 days since my last communication and 90 days since my initial communication ), XXXX XXXX has not responded to my request for verification and have not noted my dispute on my credit profile, as required by law including for credit inquiries."
Vehicle loan or lease,"My car was reprocessed on XX/XX/XXXX and I contacted 5 Third Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I never received a phone call or an inquiry as to any past due balance on my account. I contacted 5 Third Bank and I was told that I had missed a payment in XX/XX/XXXX which was over two years ago. I have made consistent payments of XXXX dollars for the last 6 years on my account online from my XXXX XXXX account online and have made consistent payments that posted on the same day of the month. Not only have I made additional payments of the loan, I called and spoke representative to inquiry about my balance and they always stated that they send me my payment history rather then going over my account over the phone in regards to the payments made. I requested several times to speak with executive relations department about my balance and account and I constantly get transferred or disconnected. I had an issue in XX/XX/XXXXof an illegal reprocession and I was never contacted that I missed any payment on my account. The bank claimed that there was a ceased and assist on my account and I requested the recording of such requests since I never requested no contact on my account. I was also told when there was a reprocession on the account that there was no updated telephone number on the account. I gave them my contacted telephone number and I have never missed any consecutive payments other than there was one partial payment in XX/XX/XXXX and I have made XXXX monthly payments for six years. I was given incorrect information and the bank refused to go over my account. Not only was my car reprocessed the second time, I was not given any paperwork from the agent when I obtained my car and I was told that I will receive a notice within 10 days. I spoke to a representative on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that there was XXXX balance due and I made a payment for XXXX dollars to retain my car and I was that it was payments from XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I made a XXXX. payment on XX/XX/XXXX and I being charged for late fee, repo fees and additional fees by third party company and I being denied complete records of my account and constantly getting nasty rude and unprofessional customer service representative who given incorrect information and payments."
