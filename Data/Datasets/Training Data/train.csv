Checking or savings account,"I recently had at least two account sold by XXXX XXXX to Flagstar Bank, which caused me to be unable to access server all XXXX dollars I desperately needed. I now live >100 miles from the nearest branch, so all of my XXXX XXXX banking was done online. I became aware that XXXX XXXX was planning to sell my savings account. First, I spoke to a XXXX XXXX representative about my wish to have my account remain with XXXX XXXX, but I was told there was nothing I could do. 

I told the representative my plan to drain the savings account, and at no point did the XXXX XXXX rep mention my checking account was moving to Flagstar too. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my checking and savings were moved to Flagstar.

I made 3 calls total to try to get access to my money between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. Flagstar is online banking was completely in accessible during this time. I never wanted to be a Flagstar bank customer, and now they have multiple accounts opened in my name. What concerns me even more, is that they refuse to close the accounts without several pieces of highly sensitive personal information being mailed or faxed to their corporate office. It seems crazy to me that a bank would be allowed to open accounts in my name without my consent. I would really rather not create a paper trail of my personal information for clock Flagstar to use to advertise to me. Furthermore I learned they are using my Social Security number as a login for the online banking portal which leads me to believe their security practices are subpar to say the least."
Vehicle loan or lease,"To whom it may concern I have contact ally and explained them my financial hardship situation thats been going on for about 12 months or a bit less.

Debt collection,"I have called and mailed letters on several occasions regarding accounts opened fraudulently in my name and I included the Official Affidavit form, Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft Report and Local Police Report. The company keeps on responding with a denial letter which changes each time. One denial letter will state that Merchandise was shipped to customer 's verified address which nothing was ever delivered to my address and I have asked for signatures to prove who was signing for these items which they never would provide. I also asked for a copy of the application in my name which they refuse to provide and also the information used to open the account does not match my information along with the security questions do not match my answers. I never applied for any credit card and there have been several opened with Synchrony Bank and they refuse to accept that this is Identity Theft. The other denial letter states that the account opened greater than 1 year with verifiable payment history which they say was made using a XXXX XXXX  account. I have never had a XXXX XXXX  account and have definitely not made any payments to this company. They also state that customer benefited from use of card/participated in the purchases. I have never even received a credit card from this company and have definitely not participated nor benefited from any purchases. Synchrony Bank is a Fraudulent company who refuses do accept that I am a victim of Identity Theft."

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Repeated Harassment I was given a loan through the mail with XXXX XXXX, with brief description of terms and conditions. Even during the time that I was making my payments as regularly scheduled I would continuously receive calls from their employees throughout the week before my payment was due, after it was due and I was just one day off from making my payment, even though I had 10 days to still make my payment before a late fee was even added, they would repeatedly call starting from sometimes XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   until XXXX at XXXX, and even though I would make my payments they would make me wait at a local until they contacted whichever branch/office the loan was from until they would allow me to leave and give me a receipt regarding the payment I was making. 
Things started to get even worse with this company when I lost my job and had to delay XX/XX/XXXX payments a little, and although I informed them of my situation and offered to do they would continue to harass me throughout the week, and on a daily basis they would call me every one to two hours with it being a different representative on the phone. When I tried to setup arrangements to at least make payments with the funds ( {$25.00} ) I had available, the guy name XXXX, also XXXX, or another CSR refused to accept what I was able to give and said that I had to come up with more money than that and that if I couldn't I need to hold the money until I was able to give the entire amount ( {$160.00} ), then the calls continued to escalate with the representatives and the XXXX contacting me several times, sending me letter even after I made a full payment to the point that the XXXX left threating voicemail on my phone repeatedly, I am degraded by their personnel with unprofessional remarks when I go in to make payments. This harassment of this company daily is affecting me mental and physically to the point I'm afraid to answer my phone due to the continuous calling they do to me throughout each day and this has gone on for some months now none stop. Even if I communicate with them to try and let them know when I will be in to make a payment they still continue to call me ( causing to miss very important calls because they continue to tie up my line ) Now it interferes with my work. This company does not hold people privacy a priority, seaming that they sent me someone else 's loan document in the mail with all the persons ' personal information on it, if they are this careless with someone else, they can do the same with me. Furthermore, I am not the only one who has experience this type of service from this company, other people who are elderly have also told me that they have experience the same. The local company offices try to make you come in and resign your loan in the office as a way of putting you in a higher interest rate than the one you were initially in causing your actual loan to skyrocket double or triple times the amount you actual had due to start with, as their way of helping you with your situation so they say. I just want the repeated harassment to stop, all the calls and letters are not necessary, and I don't think it is right that when you do try to make some form of payment they refuse you, in order to gain higher interest on you by trying to get you to sign a different agreement than the first one. Especially when they have limited options to make payments because their website does not deduct your funds correctly from your account causing you to go in the local office because of repeated calls saying they haven't received your payment although you attempted to make it online. No one deserves this treatment rather your paying on-time or late ( even the amount of time they allow you to make your payment, they harassed me through the entire period )"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Account Name : XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) I would like to address this issue of this inaccurate account on my credit report. I followed your advice about contacting the collector.I sent them a letter by certified mail and it was received on XX/XX/2018 and asked them to verify the debt and investigate. As oftodaythey still have not responded to me with sufficient information.The company responded by sending me a copy of an old bill from the original company I had services with that had no other information on it stating they were authorized to collect on it. The old bills don't match the amounts that are being reported on my credit report. They also didn't provide proof that they are authorized to collect on a debt. This debt was not properly verified and I don't believe that it is mine. None of the credit bureaus have remedied this issue. I thought they had 30 days to investigate and fix the inaccurate account listed. It has been over 45 days and this debt has not been verified nor has it been removed from my credit profile.

Checking or savings account,"I started a XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX company a few years ago, and I travel around the country visiting XXXX. In XX/XX/2016, I received 5+ missed calls while I was in DC for work. I had used my computer at the XXXX I was staying at and at a few coffee shops. I call the number back and a woman from XXXX, Texas asked, "" Is this ( company name )? I received a notification from my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) that there is suspicious activity and someone is trying to transfer money into my account. '' Me "" Yes, this is ( company name ). Who is this? I am not trying to transfer money, but I will check with my bank and call you back. '' When I check my account initially, I did not see any unusual payments. So assumed it was some sort of mistake. But then a few days later, I noticed a XXXX in the amount of {$3700.00} which I did not recognize. I was thinking that maybe I was paying an invoice to someone. But when I saw who is was going to, I had no idea who this person was, and there were no open invoices that matched that amount in my accounts payable. I reported there was a XXXX transfer made that I had no idea about, and I did not approve. It was not done by any of the signers on the account. Funds are returned to my account. 

I go into a physical Chase location, filed a claim for it, and we closed the bank account. I was told that I would receive an email with an attachment that I need to fax in. 
So I wait and wait, and after a couple weeks go by, I call chase and ask them what the status of my claim is. They said that they did not receive my faxed form and so there was no progress on the claim. I explained that I was still waiting to receive it via email. By the way, I was still receiving other chase notifications, so I assumed that they had my email correct. They said they would email it in 1-2 business days. I asked him on the phone if he could email it to me while we were talking so that I can make sure that I got it. He said he could not do that but assured me that I would receive it in 24-48 hours.. 
I get a voicemail from Chase. "" We need more information to continue our research of your claim. Please call us as soon as possible and refer to claim number # # # # # # # # #. '' I called the number in the email and explained what happened. They told me that my claim was closed because I never faxed in the form, and I responded that I never received the form. Then the Chase Agent sent me a link that allowed me to download the chase form to fax. ( Why couldn't they do that in the first place? ) I asked him if I can speak with someone from the team that is doing the investigation, and he replied that I can not and they will contact me and to look out for a phone number starting with XXXX or XXXX. I fill out form and drop it off at Chase to be faxed in. 

They never called despite me requesting over and over that they call me. My Chase agent was amazing and tried so hard to help me get ahold of someone in the Investigations team, but she ended up just sitting on the phone for hours with no luck. I was told that they tried to call me once, and I didn't answer so they never called again. I have even looked through my phone since then and have not missed any calls from a phone number starting with those digits. I had made sure that if I saw any XXXX or XXXX numbers calling me, I would answer immediately, even if I was in a meeting or busy with something else. 

A few days later, I receive an email from Chase saying they "" issued a temporary credit in the amount of {$3700.00} for claim # # # # # # # #. You'll have full use of the temporary funds while we do our research. '' Thanks for calling us. Welcome to theChaseCustomer Claims Secure Document Exchange I  called the woman who called me at the beginning saying that she had received the money in her XXXX XXXX Account, no answer. 

I notice that chase has removed the funds from my account.I spend 50 minutes on the phone with Chase and am transferred from person to person. I keep asking for more information so that I can understand what exactly is going on with my account, and why the claim was dropped. After a very long and frustrating conversation, the guy on the phone tells me that the reason they denied the claim was because there was another XXXX transfer made from the same IP address on for {$80.00} that I did not claim. I told him that I did not make that transfer and asked him to file a claim for both. He said that they already closed the claim and he could not reopen it. After arguing for 20 more minutes, he finally agreed to file a new claim for both of the amounts. Why couldn't he have done this the first time I asked? I also asked him over and over for information on the IP addresses that the transactions were made from so that I could help prove my case. He refused. 

So I email my Chase Agent. She called Chase again and made sure they reopened claim. I emailed Chase Agent multiple to ask if there are any updates on my claim because I haven't heard anything. She keeps checking for me. 

Chase Agent emails me back, "" I just got off the phone with the claims department. They said that this claim is going to remain denied because they can not find proof that it was fraudulent. You are welcome to come back into the branch and we can try to reach out to the claims dept together or you can reach them XXXX 1. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. '' At this point, I have been talking to Chase for months, and I am super frustrated with everything in the Investigations and fraud department. It is very obvious that their goal is to not help you figure out what happened to your money. So I ask my Chase Agent if she can find outwhat EXACTLY they need from me to prove it was hacked.If they do not give me specifics I will ask my lawyer to step in. I also asked her if she could help me get information on the IP addresses that the transactions were made from so that I could help prove my case. From my standpoint, they are not even trying to help me they are just trying to throw my case out. It is also ridiculous that they have not even called me to talk to me about it and try to work with me to find a way to prove that this was fraud. I have NO information, and they are making it so incredibly difficult to get information about this fraud claim. 

So I realize that I have a friend from college that works for Chase, so I go and visit him. He helps me take my case to their Escalations Dept. The Escalations Dept calls me and I tell her the whole story and she says she will call me back on Friday with updates ( 1 hr 20 minute conversation ) She says that she can not help me because the fraud dept is telling her that the IP address used for the 2 disputed transactions is still currently being used to monitor the account. At this point I am concerned that "" they are still monitoring my account. '' Again I asked for IP address information, but again, they refused. 

I call Chase again and the agent tells me that is NOT being used to monitor my account, which doesn't make sense because that was the very reason that I was told by the Escalations Dept that it was closed to begin with. 

At this point, I realize that Chase is not going to help me at all. So I call the number of the woman who called me at the beginning. The person who answers claims to be an someone else and she doesn't know what I am talking about. Then she calls me back and says, "" I am ( her name ) and I do have your money. It was transferred in my account at XXXX XXXX and the bank put a hold on the account because I could not verify who was sending it. '' She said that she would return it to my account. But her story kept changing. First she had the full amount, then she said that she only had {$2500.00}. She told me that should were call her bank and have them return the money. 

Stop in Branch to tell my agent the whole story. She brings her manager in too. I told them that I was going to get a lawyer involved, and they gave me the number to the Chase Executive Office Line. I call them and they say they will get back to me within 48 hours. 

The gentleman from the Executive Office Line said that they could not prove that it was fraud because they were sent from my personal computer, the same one that I am currently using right now. So someone hacked into my computer without my knowledge and charged my account, and there is nothing they can do about it even though I DID NOT send or approve either of the 2 transactions."

Checking or savings account,"TO CFPB!!!! [ THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT!!! DO NOT CLOSE THE COMPLAINT IF CHASE RETURNS IT AS A DUPLICATE AGAIN!!! I AM VERY UPSET BY CHASE 'S ACTIONS AND BY CFPB ACTIONS and ADMIN PROCESS WHEN YOU CLOSED MY COMPLAINT SIMPLY BECAUSE CHASE SAID IT WAS A DUPLICATE!!! OMBUDSMAN WAS NOTIFIED!!! ] TO CHASE : [ DO NOT MARK THIS COMPLAINT AS A DUPLICATE AGAIN!!! DOING SO WILL ONLY UPSET ME MORE AND FURTHER AGGRAVATE MY SEVERE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOUR ACTIONS!!! ] PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS TO WHICH THIS ONE IS REGARDING ARE : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. 

================ This complaint is due to my complete and utter dissatisfaction with the company 's response to my original CFPB complaints XXXX and XXXX. And this complaint is to report that most of my issues were not resolved and even aggravated by the company 's lies in the received responses, as you will see below. 

My complaints are : In regard to the letters from Chase dated XX/XX/2018, and XX/XX/2018, which are documented in both complaints above : 1 ) On the day of the incident ( XX/XX/2018 ),  after my card was blocked the first time, I did receive the email from Chase asking to confirm the transactions that were responsible for the block of my card. I did click "" yes '' in the email and received a successful confirmation that everything should be fine and I can make my transaction now. 

2 ) After trying to do the transaction again at the same ATM for the same amount and having sufficient funds in the account, I was unable to do so again. I called customer service and they assured me that they unblocked it now for sure and everything should be fine and I can make my transaction. I was asked for my info, I verified my ID and everything else that they have required from me to unblock the card. They GUARANTEED that it will work and everything should be fine.

3 ) After I went back to the same ATM and tried to do the transaction for the same amount again ( 3rd time now ) I was blocked again and I was unable to do my transaction. I called the customer service again and had to verify all info again, at which point I was told by the rep that they can't unblock my card and I need to call the Fraud Dept. 

4 ) Once I have reached the Fraud Dept by phone and before I was connected to the rep, I have heard very clearly the following message which I quote to my best ability : "" your conversation with us is going to be recorded to prevent fraud and your voice is being analyzed and will be used in the future for your recognition and ID ''. This was completely outrageous and upsetting because I was simply put before the fact, I was not provided with a choice to opt out and use some alternative way to resolve my issues with the company, and I was not asked for permission to do this. This was also the first time I have ever heard anywhere such a message and there was absolutely no reason to give me such a message since I am not a criminal or under investigation by LE for any financial crimes. I was not trying to commit any fraud and I was with the company for many years, always in good standing. Not to mention that recording conversations without two-party consent is absolutely illegal in California and the second part about the use of AI to obtain my "" voiceprint '' for ID, recognition and other purposes, and without my consent or a valid reason, is even more illegal and a complete violation of my rights and financial privacy. Moreover, in the latter dated XX/XX/2018, the company admitted, confirmed, and stated in writing that on XX/XX/2018 I have elected to opt-out from voice recognition and they supposedly honored that. Considering this, the company admitted doing wrong and most certainly committed a crime by doing completely opposite at the time of my call to the Fraud Dept. 4 ) The company never acknowledged that the rep from a Fraud Dept. ( a woman ) was disciplined or fired for humiliating me and talking to me like I am a dirty animal or a petty criminal. So I demand that the company fires this individual because they ignored my concerns completely and did not even apologize. I will not accept anything less than the firing of that woman.

5 ) I was also told by this very angry and threatening woman that I must come to the Branch and she was even more upset when I have told her that I am XXXX and my XXXX XXXX has XXXX XXXX XXXX which prevents me from going anywhere, driving at all, and driving safely too. She said that she did not care and this is what must do. My requests to provide me with a reasonable accommodation only further angered that XXXX and she denied me my ADA rights with complete disrespect or concern. 


XXXX ) The bank was most certainly aware of my XXXX because I was getting direct deposit from XXXX to my account for many years and I also stated that I am XXXX during many times they have requested to update info online. So the company 's statement that they were not advised or had any knowledge about my XXXX and inability to come to the branch is the absolute and blatant lie on their behalf. 

7 ) I had to go to the branch anyway since this was the only option that I was left with to make a needed transaction, which greatly aggravated nerve pain in my foot and put myself and others in great danger since I had to drive there. I also received a huge emotional trauma from all this on that day which further aggravated my health.

8 ) I did have to go the branch yet again the next day ( XXXX ) since I have decided to close the account and withdraw the remainder of my money because I did not want to have any more problems like that, because my card was still not working and because I did not want to be a client of a company that does things like that. I closed my account and withdrew all of my funds on XXXX @ XXXX but I was given a paper that stated that my account is not closed yet and just "" being closed '', so I do not know if it was closed completely. I also do not know if I was not charged any unauthorized fees but I am willing to overlook this particular matter since I think I got most of my money back from the bank. Once I closed the account, I lost access to transactions list, which is why I can't confirm this although I don't have a problem with this. I have attached proof of what I was saying as far as confirming all transactions via email request by the bank and also that my account was "" being closed '' when I asked it to be closed. I also have a call log that confirms that I had to call the bank 4 times that I reported and that I had to drive twice to the bank 's branch which was very dangerous and messed up my health. Let me know if you need this information. This is why I consider most issues still unresolved to my satisfaction and I am still very upset and frustrated. Please help me. Thank you."
Mortgage,"I am currently in foreclosure at the beginning of this process I hired an attorney with the intention of keeping my home.

Vehicle loan or lease,This is reference to regional acceptance corporation. I have been constantly lied to by this company. I asked them what the amount was that I owed to bring the account current and so I won't get assessed late fees they have given me so many incorrect amounts I go good for 4 month and then they turn around and say I owe late fees or certain hidden fees that I was never made aware of my payments have always been on time have always been met and they are tacking on all these additional fees and they are not willing to wave any of them or explain in a defenate answer what they are in relation too.

Could not complete process for experian credit report, subsequent requests error out. I assume account was locked from free report Tried to go on experian website and create account, says they have a problem with my identity ( if there is a fraudulent car loan, of course home address was changed by criminal ). 

Uploading docs to their website is terrible, and they keep requesting I jump through more and more hoops. 

Tried to call provided number, system is entirely automated and kicks me off if I ask for 'operator ' or 'manager ' or 'live person '. Again system says it can't verify who I am when prompted for home address ( again because the fraudulent loan probably caused that record to be updated in Experian 's system ). 

I want access to my credit report and I want Experian to expunge the bad loan data from their system. I then need to trace down the bank involved and get my name off it as well."

I called XXXX XXXX and the number listed on my credit report to report the additional inquiry. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Paypal Mastercard to inform them I had never received the paypals extra mastercard, upon speaking with the individual from the fraud dept she had put a restriction on my account, I then spoke with another individual who proceeded with a phone call back verification number that I received, however, the representative said they where unable to proceed with verification because of my internet/phone, and said I will be receiving a letter with the instructions on how to proceed with identity verifications. I called XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX phone number XXXX to obtain more information on what had occurred, and was told to wait 7-10 days until I received the letter with the credit card.

At this time, I have written this complaint because I believe either the credit agency XXXX  and XXXX failed to provide accurate information to Synchrony to verify my identity. The issue remains, I had never received my card and they placed restrictions on my account, and I have still not received an adequate explanation from Synchrony on what had transpired between my application and verifications.

I am asking the CFPB to send my complaint to Synchrony Bank/ Financial and XXXX  and XXXX  as these are the credit agencies responsible for failing to maintain accurate information.

Debt collection,"The company Certegy did NOT contact me in any way about a problem with a check. They immediately turned it over to a collection agency. The money was in the bank for the check. It was a cashier error. The cashier had a problem pushing my check through the machine so he wrote void on my check, entered my information in the register & had me sign electronically. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. This was on a checking account I share with my mother. On XX/XX/XXXX I had a personal check denied at another store. When I called about it I was told I had a "" returned check "". This was the check I wrote on the account I share with my mother. 
What caused the problem is this : the cashier entered my check number where my account number belongs & the account number where the check number belongs, therefore it did not recognize my account. 
IF I had been notified this could have been cleared up faster. I feel my credit and my mothers credit has been damaged by this going directly to a collection agency. 
Is this legal? Don't they have to notify people first? 
On XX/XX/XXXX I authorized XXXX  to withdraw the money to pay the check but as of XX/XX/XXXXthere was still a CLAIM showing. This is not right.

The new cards came in about a week later with instruction on activating then, I called to activate them and they refused to do so said they were investigation the account, i replayed that they should since i reported it. I since have have had several conversation with branch office and credit card division the branch office didn't seem to understand what was going on. I ask the credit card division if they were not going to reopen the card to lower the interest rate and either combine the cards together for a lower payment since i could not use them. They replayed that I was making the payment and that they could not do that. As of the middle of XXXX the credit cards have been taken off line which is how i look after them and make payments. 
I feel that they have mishandled the case all the way around. I do not feel that I should have to pay high interest rates on accounts that I can't use. I thought I was doing right in reporting the activated on the account..."

Student loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX my loans were transferred to XXXX  from XXXX because I signed up for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program as a XXXX XXXX. In XXXX they notified me that my monthly payment would be over {$850.00} which I can not afford ( I was always paid ahead on XXXX and never had such a high payment, but that started over with XXXX  ). I switched to the PAYE program in XXXX and request a reduced payment forbearance ( {$5.00} ) for XXXX. They sent a letter stating they would send a bill for {$5.00} but NOT to pay the {$5.00} until I received the bill. I waited and waited. Twice I called XXXX to see where my bill was but they insisted that I should NOT pay the {$5.00} until I get the bill otherwise it would go towards my balance and not towards the change in payment plans. I never received the bill. I have screenshots and proof that I never received the bill. Eventually, on a third attempt to contact XXXX to ask where the bill was, the customer service rep I spoke with said my bill was overdue and I was disapproved for the PAYE because I was late paying the bill and would now go back on full standard payment schedule. I protested and they said they would resubmit the payment plan request. However, because I was "" late '' paying the bill, I could not afford the XXXX bill of  {$850.00} so I had to request a forbearance again. After this forbearance ended, XXXX capitalized my interest in the amount of {$720.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I again protested that it was the fault of XXXX that I was late paying my bill and thus forced to request a forbearance. The manager I spoke with that day agreed and submitted a request to the U.S. Department of Education to reverse the interest capitalization. The request was submitted XX/XX/XXXX. It was approved XX/XX/XXXX. Several customer service reps I spoke with all acknowledged the approval. I have it in writing that they acknowledged it. First I was told that it would take 30 days to show on my account. After 30 days and no change, I called again. Then I was told it would actually take 90 days to reflect on my account. After 90 days I called again. Then I was told that they could see the approved reversal in the system but that there must be an issue causing it not to reflect on the account. We are now in XX/XX/XXXX. The person that day told me it would take about 72 hours to reflect on my account and that she would call me back in a week. A week goes by with no call. I call again and was told that if someone said they would call me back that I should wait until I get a call back. After another week and some change I called on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point, the woman on the phone told me that a review was completed on XX/XX/XXXX and that my request to reverse the interest capitalization was denied. After being told several times by customer service representatives since XXXX that the request was approved and will be reversed soon, that it was a matter of time or a matter of a technical glitch, I was being told completely opposite information that it was denied. I never at any point received correspondence or an explanation about the request, the decision, what to expect, or what the next steps were throughout this entire process and all correspondence on the issue was initiated by me. Every month that the interest capitalization is not reversed despite it's approval, I gain interest on a principal amount that is inaccurate due to the XXXX system never sending me a bill in XXXX. It has been 5 months now which means the {$720.00} has accrued {$180.00} in interest and will continue to collect interest until it is resolved. The lack of communication and random unexplained sudden denial of a process that was approved back in XXXX is unfair, inaccurate, and quite frankly is just pure theft."
Checking or savings account,On the XX/XX/XXXX I was cut a check in the amount of XXXX ... I wasnt thinking due to the fact that bills where passed due and Ive never had problems with this before I downloaded the banking App to deposit said check normally my bank in the past has granted me some money available but they didnt. On the next business day which would have been Tuesday the XXXX I called my bank and they told me I had to wait till it was done processing to have the deposit canceled as I needed money to pay bills. As expected my phone got shut off and the insurance lapses as well and I almost lost power due to Bank Of America neglecting to properly advise me. Since I also bank with the same bank the check was written from I asked if they had cleared it. I had been robbed two days prior and now I had another issue trying to get a state ID. Little to my surprise I recived back pay from another job and a new bank card as I went to try and cash them I ran into another problem apparently fraud had take. Affect and Bank of America neglected to inform me once again that they locked my card becuase of this now I was in panic and worse off then before. I called the number they asked me to call and asked them to unlock the card they placed me on hold over 2 hours before I hung up and called back again I did this several times before I lost it and profanity came out while on the phone with a representative. By gods good grace my other bank cleared my checks and I was able to pay said late bills with penelties. Now Bank Of America said they will hold my funds till the XXXX due to fraud in the area I live in. Thats fine but not understandable considering my other bank already released the funds and now my bank card through Bank of America has to be canceled. So now I dont have a bank card Im planning on closing my account but I fear they will not give me whats rightfully mine if thats the case I will place a new complaint
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called PNC Bank to open a dispute for the full amount ( {$220.00} ) of a transaction that posted to my debit card on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a questionnaire in the mail asking for an explanation "" describing the nature of your dispute, and the dollar amount of the error. '' I mailed back the attached explanation the following day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter asking for a copy of a receipt or billing statement. I called to inform that I don't have a receipt or billing statement. This was clearly indicated in the written explanation I had mailed earlier. 

On XXXX I received a letter informing me that my claim had been denied. I called, and was told the claim was denied because a receipt would be necessary to process a partial amount dispute. I was confused because I was disputing the full amount of the transaction. The representative told me the dispute was opened in the system as a partial dispute, and I should have noticed that the incorrect amount was temporarily provisioned back to my account. I countered by saying that in my written explanation I had indicated a dollar amount of the error that was the full amount of the transaction, which clearly no one read at any point. The rep refiled the dispute, and told me I may be getting additional questions in the mail. I became concerned that I already received a questionnaire to which I responded previously, and would not want to be receiving the exact same questions again. The rep assured me that all documents from the original dispute would be transferred to the refiled dispute, and I should only receive requests for new information. 

Sure enough, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received in the mail the exact same template questionnaire I had received the first time around. I mailed back the exact same explanation ( attached )."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am filing this complaint because Equifax ( credit file confirmation # XXXX ), XXXX  ( credit file # XXXX ), and XXXX  has ignored my request to provide me with the documents that their company has on file that was used to verify the accounts I disputed. Being that they have gone past the 30 day mark and can not verify these accounts, under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA- they are required to "" ... promptly delete all information which can not be verified '' that I have disputed. Please resolve this manner as soon as possible. Thank you."
Checking or savings account,"My payment account for paying a bill was changed without my approval. This has happened twice. Yesterday I got the bank to deactivate the my second account from the bill pay service ( I never activated it and do not have the ability to activate or deactivate the account myself ). But this was just a work around to try to prevent the issue from happening again. Their system is still broken and they are suggesting I am making the change using their website. 

Today I noticed a bill was paid twice from their system. From the bill pay system, it only showed 1 time in the history even through it had already cleared the bank. They completed the transaction electronically and not using checks. So it was not because the receiver processed the check twice. The representative acknowledged they are aware of their system sending transactions on the incorrect day, but did not acknowledge the lack of recording transactions. 

Both these situations mean this bank is changing banking transactions as well as not recording them correctly."
Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase bank to change a payment date from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. The bank rep explained this call was being recorded. I explained my payment needed to be changed to XX/XX/XXXX. The bank rep changed the date as requested, repeated the transaction to me for confirmation and I agreed with him to complete the transaction. On XX/XX/XXXX, I  receive a notice from my bank of an overdraft fee {$35.00} for a payment of {$450.00} for my car payment. I contact Chase Bank to explain the NSF fee due to a payment that was not authorized. Chase Bank explained they needed to review the call with a supervisor to refund the NSF {$35.00} fee. After an hour I was still on the phone waiting for them to process my "" approved '' refund by this supervisor. The bank rep explained I could end the call due to the time it took, call back the next day for confirmation of the refund. The next day I call back and the bank rep explained I need to prove to them that an error had occurred. I couldn't believe my ears. The bank rep said that even though there was an error by Chase, they needed to confirm I was charged a fee from my bank. I asked them why would they not have explained that during the first call, especially since we were on the phone for more than an hour. The bank rep said to process my claim I had to prove they made an error and that my bank charged a fee. I explained to them that by the time I finish this claim, it may have cost me approximately {$100.00} in time and frustration. I asked to speak to a manager during the last call. The manager explained she was sorry for my inconvenience, however, she would have to receive proof that I had a payment process incorrectly and then prove there was a fee assessed as a result. I explained to her my next move would be to write the CFPB if they could not make the necessary corrections and take care of this complaint as a first call resolution. She kindly said thank you and disconnected the call. I did not plan to spend this much time and effort on this complaint. I have to say that I feel like I've experienced both insult and injury on this one. Chase bank makes an unauthorized payment on my account, then tells me that the mistake was made by them. Then Chase bank tells me I have to prove they made a mistake and prove I was assessed fees by my bank after listening to at least 3 different bank reps, and supervisors tell me that the error was with Chase bank. Finally, I was disconnected by a supervisor who could have cared less that I just went through "" XXXX '' and back with Chase on a simple bank error. I know Chase is a very large financial institution, and I should have known not to upset the giant bank. It's the principal of the matter. I'm a customer, infact, I'm a new customer. My next complaint is that the interest rate is too high. I should not have such a high interest rate. Please look in to these matters and take appropriate action. It's still America and the customer should have a more positive experience than this one. Even the small customers."

The Amsher representative told me I had to email the proof to her or it would be reported on my credit report. I did. Then, in XXXX, I received notification from my credit monitoring company that Amsher reported me as unpaid in collections. I contacted Amsher again, they said the debt was valid.

Student loan,"Navient wrongly placed my loan into in-school deferment sometime in XXXX. I was not given a notice of this, but a blurb was buried on my XX/XX/2018 statement. Having been enrolled in Autopay, I do not routinely check my statements, instead relying on my Loan Servicer to collect the payment appropriately and keep me on track for full repayment by my maturity date. Never having requested in-school deferment, Navient neglected to collect my loan payment for the following months, until I discovered it today. Upon contacting Navient by phone on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX Pacific time, I  spoke with XXXX, Rep XXXX. She claimed that I was sent a communication in the Navient portal, and upon further questioning realized that no separate notification existed. It was instead an after-the-fact notification on a monthly statement, after the change had been made without my consent, hidden in a monthly statement that I had not been checking because my loan was enrolled in automatic payments. I have asked that Navient refund the capitalized interest, and indemnify me from their mistake by crediting the accrued interest from the deferment that I did not request. When XXXX declined to do so, I asked to speak with a supervisor. XXXX, XXXX, joined the phone call, giving her title as Supervisor. "" On behalf on Navient I sincerely apologize that you were not notified. '' She confirmed that during the deferment period that my loan was put on, not only were payments not collected, but a 0.5 % interest rate reduction for being enrolled in autopay was also removed. I requested that my loan be removed from deferment immediately, and that regular payments begin being made. This call lasted approximately 50 minutes. As a result, I have had over {$250.00} in additional interest be capitalized to the loans principal, and have not had over {$1000.00} in principal reduction made."

Student loan,"I refinanced the loans that I had with Discover Student Loans through a new finance company. The loans were scheduled to be paid off right around the same time that my payment was due. I contacted Discover on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX EST to inquire if I should make a payment if the payoff was not completed by my due date. I was advised that I should not make a payment because they would have to issue a credit. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Discover Student Loans again because the payoffs had not been updated on their system. My refinance company had advised that the payoffs were sent on XX/XX/XXXX. During this call I was immediately advised that I needed to arrange to make a payment. I explained my previous call and inquired if the account was noted with this information to which I was advised that it was not. I was advised that they would make a notation of what I was previously advised. On XX/XX/XXXX I accessed my account online and found that payments had posted but not fully paid off. The amount that I refinanced equaled the total amount owed to Discover Student Loans. I contacted Discover on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX EST and was advised that some payments may not have posted as of yet but at this point I was missing {$57000.00} out of a total amount of {$110000.00}. This representative generously went into each loan and provided me the amount of funds that posted from each check. My refinance company sent 5 checks, 1 for each loan but Discover took funds from each check and applied it to each loan. The check # s XXXX {$20000.00}, XXXX {$12000.00}, XXXX {$27000.00}, XXXX {$27000.00}, and XXXX {$26000.00}. Out of all of these funds only {$58000.00} was posted towards my loans. XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Discover again because my account was still in the same status, at this time I advised that this needed to be escalated because my finance company had verified that the checks had cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. I had a conference call with my finance company and Discover in order to have them escalate this situation. I received 2 phone calls back from Discover stating that they needed the check numbers from my finance company in order to submit an escalation. My finance company sent Discover confirmation of payment as well as copies of the cleared checks. This information was electronically sent on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my account was still in the status of owing {$58000.00} now due to interest. My Co-Signor and myself scheduled the day off work in order to attempt to get this resolved. I phoned Discover Student Loans at XXXX EST on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested to speak with a Supervisor- XXXX- who advised that it could take another 5 days until the escalation was reviewed and funds processed. I requested to speak with his supervisor as this was unacceptable. These funds were processed by Discover Student Loans on XX/XX/XXXX and as of XX/XX/XXXX my account was not showing a paid in full status. XXXX supervisor was to contact me back between XXXX EST. I received no call to which I contacted them again at XXXX. This time I spoke with a XXXX who stated that funds were being processed as we were speaking. He stated that the supervisor XXXX was still not available. I requested that XXXX contact me back within the next hour, to which I still did not receive a call. I contacted Discover yet again at XXXX, held for while and was then connected with XXXX XXXX At this time funds had been posted to my loans but I still had a balance of {$7000.00} that I still owed. I was assured that this would be resolved by Monday XX/XX/XXXX. I provided XXXX with the horrific details of my many experiences with his customer care representatives and how I had to demand an escalation, provide them with the proof that they received full payments in order to get resolution. I also advised that when the payoff amounts were provided to my refinance company, I had made an additional payment to Discover before the payoffs were completed and that I should have a possible credit owed back to my finance company. He inquired if I had an amount of a credit that I should have. I advised that I did not ... Their system should be able to determine that. He then stated that he would contact me on XX/XX/XXXX and that he would be able to provide me with a $ amount that he could deposit into my bank account for my inconvenience. I continue to advise Discover that they could contact me between XXXX EST to which they continued to contact me 2 hours later because they are located in Mountain time. The 1st call I received from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX was at XXXX. He left me a message to contact him back. The 2nd phone call was at XXXX from a XXXX stating that all payments were posted and that he wanted me to authorize for them to deposit {$200.00} into my bank account as restitution. I stated that I did not feel comfortable accepting this payment as I did not feel this issue was resolved. I requested to receive records of how the interest was accrued on my accounts and wanted these documents sent to me. I was advised that they would be mailed. I have yet to receive this information. I also requested to understand how this error occurred with my funds and the explanation that I was provided was that the checks did not have account numbers on them so they did not know where to put this money. This company had record of the exact check numbers that were sent but they did not post the entire amounts of these checks. This is fraud! I need verification that the credit amount of {$400.00} listed on my account is true and accurate and not just a bogus amount. I would not authorize for them to deposit funds into my account as they wanted me to listen to a disclosure of the terms of this restitution. Through my research of my account I have found that my original loans with Discover, the 1st 3 years were all at a variable rate. I am not sure how this happened as myself nor my co-signor would have ever agreed to sign for a loan with a variable rate. I have located copies of the original promissory note that does not disclose an amount, rate or that I am agreeing to a variable rate. I again contacted Discover on XX/XX/XXXX requesting that they send me documentation showing what options I chose when I submitted the application electronically back in XXXX. I was advised at that time that they do not have this information and that the promissory note contains all this information. This representative actually uttered a subtle laugh under her breath at me when I advised that I have a copy of this promissory note that does not contain any of that information. I am to be receiving a copy of the promissory note that they have on hand which I am sure is an exact copy of the document I have."

I had NO MEANS of making the second Trial Payment, no ability to even write a check or make a telephonecall. ( I had no check book and was virtually unable to talk because of the XXXX ).

Mortgage,"I have been working with my loan servicer for well over a year with a mortgage I have been struggling to pay on a property that since the XX/XX/XXXX financial crisis is no longer worth what I owe on it. I have had a signed purchase agreement since XX/XX/XXXX for a short sale - not as much as what is owed, but a cash offer at current market value. Whether intentional or not, the process of trying to work with my loan servicer has been hindered by vague and ambiguous communications, mixed messages, and constantly changing demands from them. I have done and provided all that they have asked of me, yet to date they still have not rendered a decision on the purchase agreement that is now over a year old, nor have they offered any alternative resolution, or any relief whatsoever. I had wanted to include my request for assistance and accompanying documentation but that was 74 pages, and over the 10mb limit for attachments, but I am including a letter from my loan servicer acknowledging receipt of this information. I am also including a recent email from the title company who is working on the short sale, as well as a XX/XX/XXXX letter from my loan servicer notifying me that the status and my request had changed, but neglecting to disclose what the change was, why it had occurred, or what I needed to do about it. My attempts to resolve this issue were again met with mixed messages and changing demands before it was finally resolved. A letter with complete information would have clarified the issue and facilitated a much speedier resolution."
Student loan,"I have had several problems with XXXX XXXX. Every year I have to submit my employment verification form several times in order to get it processed, even though I serve in the XXXX. I have also had trouble with deferment issues. I am currently enrolled in a Master 's program part-time and every semester XXXX automatically puts my account in deferment. I call and submit the deferment waiver form to be taken out of deferment because I am in the PSLF program and every month I am in deferment is a month that does not count towards PSLF. Every time I call and submit another deferment waiver form I get told that it takes time to process and that it will all be sorted out, but this seems to be a pattern with XXXX and I can not figure out why I keep getting put in automatic deferment when I have specifically requested to not be placed in deferment. Additionally, when I applied for PSLF, all of my loan where transferred from XXXX to XXXX. During this period I was unable to access my account to ensure my payments where being processed. I made several calls and every time I was told not to worry I would have access to my account "" soon ''. By the time I got access XXXX informed that my loans where past due because I failed to pay on time. Then a year later they tell me because I had a late payment that my forbearance funds were being nullified and the interest was being added to my account. This only amounted to around 150 additional dollars but its about principal. This company has failed me and other customers at every turn. Furthermore, they seem to not care about the effect that their malfeasance has on borrowers. In fact, I seldom receive customer care that is not rude even borderline hostile when I call about my account. Including today XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, after waiting no less than 20 minutes on hold I was greet by XXXX, employee number XXXX, who could not have been more rude and insensitive about the fact that my account was being placed back in deferment and I was having to take time out of my duty day to attempt to correct this action again. I want to know when XXXX will be held accountable for their deceptive practices relating to deferment and public student loan forgiveness."

Debt collection,"When I started working on my credit in XX/XX/XXXX I had a debt listed on my report from a company called XXXX for a XXXX bill in the amount of XXXX. I disputed this debt as it did not belong to me and was listed under a name I had never gone by, XXXX XXXX ( my maiden last name is XXXX ). XXXX was unable to verify this debt and it was eventually removed from my credit report. on XX/XX/XXXX I received a credit notification that I had a collection added to my report. The debt was from XXXX XXXX XXXX for this XXXX  bill that I mentioned above. The issue here is 1 ) I never received anything in writing from XXXX XXXX regarding this debt, therefore I was not given the chance to request validation or dispute this debt. 2 ) I was not notified by either XXXX  or XXXX regarding this debt being reinserted into my credit file, therefore it was illegally reinserted. I disputed this debt with XXXX  and XXXX already and both came back verified as accurate. This debt does not belong to me."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have attached a copy of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau order of 2015 pertaining to the collection process on medical debts. This federal agency has levied millions in penalties against several medical collection agencies for abusive collection practices since the 2015 mandate that consumers must be granted 180 days-notice that any or all medical debts can not be posted against a consumers credit report. What this entails is that I as an American consumer needs time to either settle a medical collection before said collection gets posted on my credit report, or that my medical insurance carrier had enough time to resolve the collection either in full or by any sustained factoring agreement in place with the medical servicer, be it a physician, clinic, ambulance service or hospital. That has not been the case in the attached medical collection ( s ) posted on Experian, XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectfully. Since the 2015 agreement between the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and all three credit reporting agencies, medical collection agencies have violated this agreement in its entirety. Having established that there is a specified procedure in place on medical collection postings on a consumers credit, it is a fact that most if not all medical collectors are in violation of their subscriber agreement with the major credit reporting agencies. Since my rights have already been violated by the collection agency stated in this complaint, the collection should be VOID completely. I am not disputing any factual conclusion if I was even given medical attention, just stating that my personal credit history has been damaged by an unlawful collection practice. I should be entitled to damages for the overall cost involved with what would otherwise be a perfect credit history. Accordingly, I respectfully request for the disputed medical collection ( s ) to be deleted permanently, and if this particular collection agencies needs a remedy for collection, it has abused the credit reporting system by violating my rights. In my opinion the only recourse at this time would be moving forward through other collection processes outside of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The disputed collection must be deleted permanently, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must sanction and fine the agency for its abusive actions. The credit reporting agencies should also terminate the subscriber agreement if place. My dispute is based on material facts and current policies on medical collections. The attached disputed collection ( s ) should be deleted permanently without any right to reinsert from this point forward."

Mortgage,"Lender : Webster Bank in Connecticut ( XXXX, their public number ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged a late fee of {$46.00} for a required payment of {$29.00} that was due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I feel that this action by the Bank is unfair and deceptive. 

I asked the bank to kindly waive the fee. They refused. 

This is a variable loan, so I have been making a recurring payment of {$900.00} for the past several months, an amount that exceeded the minimum payment amount. The loan repriced in XXXX, which I wasn't tracking. 

As a result, the {$900.00} that the Bank received on XX/XX/XXXX was {$29.00} short of the minimum amount due. Immediately upon receipt of banks past due notice on XX/XX/XXXX, I called the Bank and brought the account current that day with a transfer of {$29.00} from the linked DDA account at the Bank. 

The late fee of {$46.00} is 5 % of the minimum amount owed which was {$920.00}. 

I feel the Bank 's charge is unfair, at I think it is unfair to charge {$46.00} on a short-payment of {$29.00}. As I brought the loan current on XX/XX/XXXX, I believe this amounts to a 5700 % interest rate on the amount owed of {$29.00}. I think a reasonable person would regard this practice as unfair. 

I think it is deceptive, because a condition of the loan is that I am required to maintain a linked non-interest bearing checking account and grant to the Bank a right of offset for the outstanding payment on the load. The linked checking account had a balance exceeding the {$29.00} that was owed. 

I think it's deceptive to require a linked checking account, ask for a right of offset, and then choose to charge a late fee of {$46.00} when the only reason to require the right of offset is to make the transfer from the DDA when required."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",I reported an international wire fraud scam to the bank relating to a vacation property that we were trying to rent. The person had us wire {$5800.00} to their account and we were later noticed that they did not own the property. I contact Chase to stop the wire at which time the bank told me they request the funds back from the other bank. There was no correspondence from Chase at all regarding this case. It took me calling them repeatedly to track down the right department to give me information regarding the case. When I finally spoke with the right person after contact them for 2 weeks I was told there was nothing they could do because it was my word against theirs. Their lack of timely processing of the wire cancel and unhelpful nature has left me with no options to get my funds back. I find this ridiculous that when fraud is reported they have no obligation to assist their customers in getting their funds back. I am truly disappointed with the level of service and lack of commitment in resolving this issue.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","please help ... 
paypal will not give me my money back, i have been on hold for days waiting for someone to get back to me since last last week straight after we spoke i called & spoke with a female agent there at paypal that assured me that these would be taken care of & posted back to my card by XX/XX/XXXX, and so here i is XX/XX/XXXX & i'm calling back and no one there knows what i'm talking about & so after about a half hour or so of giving them evidence and going back & forth with them & finally convincing the agent, she says she has to transfer me the another department ... and thus i wait on hold seriously for 3 hours & counting i just got out of the hospital the other day & had some XXXX XXXX & complications not only is sitting here having to spend my time like this not my cup of tea, but just not very comfortable at all and i'm in alot of pain. 
this is not at all how i expected this to go ... 
i thought it would just be a quick confirmation & things would be taken care of, but this is & this has been absolutely ridiculous & the worst customer service ever. 

please read & try & understand the issues here, my account has been unfairly limited & your holding on to my money that needs to be returned to me. 

your agent assured me that it would be returned to my funding source by XX/XX/XXXX & here it is XX/XX/XXXX & i can't even get anybody to talk to me. 

i spend all day on hold everyday & just being transferred around to different departments telling my story over & over were everybody just pretends like they just don't know what i'm talking about at all or just end up telling me that thats not there department & there's nothing they can do for me & transferring me again where i spend another 6 hours on hold until i get disconnected or my phone dies & this is just absolutely ridiculous & beyond absurd. 
i have 100 % positive feedback on ebay & have always been a good customer & this is a big huge mix up & misunderstanding & has just gone on for far to long & is costing me alot of business & you as well, but the bottom line is i dont care weather you want or value my business anymore or not because i really can't say i like the way you all have treated me one bit, but what i can say is that you do have to give me my money back & are obligated to do that. 

now enough is enough, please stop playing these childish games with me ... 
i'm not here to rip anybody off or rob any banks or do any such foolishness & i have always been a good customer, this is just a big misunderstanding & a big mix up & if you were in my shoes & a customer as well you would understand but all your seeing is numbers read by some computer, not situations or realities or any kind of validities as i have done nothing wrong here, but use your buyer protection on legitimate cases. 
and as you can see perfectly well on ebay i have 100 % positive feedback as a buyer & seller for years now & am not here to scam anybody, but whatever, it is what it is ... 
you can choose to take a look at it or not, its up to you, you can see it how ever you want to ... 
but the bottom line is you & your agents can't keep lying to me & holding on to my money the way you have been as there is no reason in the world for telling someone that there money will be in there account by XX/XX/XXXX, and then i call you back on XX/XX/XXXX because it's not & you wan na act like you dont know what the heck i'm talking about & then after i have to jump through a million hoops & finally prove it to your agent, then she wants to tell me that because my account is limited, my money can not be accessed & will not be returned. 

what kind of monkey business is this??? 

just return my money to the same funding source in which it came, simple as that, thank you very much. 
its the same as you did for the same sell with the other group of transactions, look there is no reason in the world for this or for this to have happened at all. i was refunded by ebay for like XXXX transactions or so from the sames seller XXXX and they all posted back to my account like straight away accept for these two that your holding on to, and i need you to please release them back to my funding source as your original agent promised me they would be by XX/XX/XXXX & Now its all this non sense.

Re : Item : XXXX Return Update SR # XXXX XXXX / Sent XXXX XXXX To : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX Item : XXXX Return Update SR # XXXX Hello XXXX, I hope your XXXX went well and you are on the road to recovery. 

I am writing to you in relation to the return you opened for the item : 'Men 's Red Ripped Jeans Pants Biker Classic Skinny Slim Straight Denim Trousers ' that you bought from the seller : XXXX. 

I reached out to the seller to try and have this matter resolved before your XXXX but unfortunately they were unable to do so. So I contacted our cases team today, because the seller is based in XXXX they have placed the case on hold and given the seller 5 days to finally organize a returns label for you or for a courier to collect the item. If they have not resolved this after the 5 days we will be closing the case in your favor and issuing you with a full refund. 

I will continue to monitor this and make sure that it doesn't cause any more inconvenience or stress especially with you recovering. 

Thank you for your time and cooperation XXXX, I will be in touch again over the next week.

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/18, I opened a Capital One Money Market Savings account that had a bonus offer of XXXX after depositing a total of XXXX by XXXX XXXX.  I made 4 seperate deposits of : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, by XXXX XXXX.  The terms stated that the bonus would be posted by 60 days after the XXXX total had been met, and the bonus still has not been posted. When i contacted capital one, I was told the the XXXX had to be deposited at one time, which is not stated at all in the terms."
Mortgage,"On on or about XX/XX/XXXX I contacted my mortgage servicer by phone, Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, to request an escrow analysis because I have {$6500.00} in my escrow account after my city taxes have been paid. My city tax and fee bill of {$5600.00} was paid in full to the City of XXXX, VA on XX/XX/XXXX and thus I have paid my taxes in full for XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$11000.00}. 

I am requesting that the balance be returned to me as I already have an escrow portion of my monthly mortgage that will sufficiently cover my first half XX/XX/XXXX city tax and insurance payment. If, for example no surplus is returned to me, by the time my city taxes are due again in XX/XX/XXXX I will have approximately double what I need to cover escrow items. 

I contacted Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing again on XX/XX/XXXX by phone after they sent me only a very small check for {$150.00}, which wasn't close to the amount I expected to receive since my taxes have been paid. After multiple failed and shifting explanations to reconcile why they could not provide me with my surplus escrow, they requested I send them a screenshot over email of the publicly accessible XXXX   City website showing that my taxes and fees have been paid in full for XX/XX/XXXX, something their own escrow department would have been able to access. I sent them a screenshot of this information on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email in reply stating that I am welcome to pay my taxes independently but that they would not do an escrow analysis until the annual analysis was due. Further, Shellpoint would not update my tax info and that they would continue to pay my tax bill without reference to the fact that it has already been paid ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and that payment predated their most recent mid XX/XX/XXXX escrow analysis. Both facts that I have communicated on several occasions and facts that should have been revealed in their escrow analysis. 

I am simply requesting that the surplus be returned to me. I understand that they can not hold more than 2 months cushion for escrow purposes. Instead they are telling me that I can not get my escrow surplus returned to me at any point in the near future."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a credit card for approx. 2 years. I asked if they had a short term plan with a lower interest because I wasn't sure how our income was going to be over the next few months, because of retirement. The customer service rep in order to qualify for the plan, you have to be in arrears. I told her it wouldn't work, because I've never missed a payment.She gave me more information along with my account would be close, but after the end of 12 months it would automatically be opened up & they would lower the interest over the 12 months also. I asked her to confirm that it would definitely reopen at the end of 12 months. She said "" Yes ''. I told her again that "" but I didn't have any late charges. She decided that if I wanted to get on the plan, she would basically see if the company would still put me on the plan. She told me she could put me on it! I was excited, but still continued to question about my great credit!! She just basically put me on it anyway. At the time, there was nothing said about why she was able to put me on the plan, except for it would still be reopen in 12 months. We were recorded, which is what I wanted anyway..plus, my husband also heard everything, because I had the rep on speaker phone, and I told her that he was sitting right by me & could hear everything that was said! I called the company in XXXX to find out my exact date in XXXX that my acct would be reopened, because I still made all my payments on time! That's when I found out that my account was not going to reopen & the rep that put me on the plan had made it look as if I missed a payment. Thank the XXXX  that I have proof from my bank draft & paper work that shows & proves that I never missed a payment. I called several times, & found out they even put my account in COLLECTIONS!!!!!!!! Then, they sent me a letter stating they were raising my interest rate even more than the original interest rate & showed that my payment would be {$100.00} ... which would be approx. {$32.00} toward principal & almost {$70.00} per month of interest & on this {$100.00} would take me 8 years to pay it off. I still can't believe they did this!! This is the employee ID for this rep ( XXXX  ) No one would give me her name, or no one at the company would even discuss why this was done, but the agreed that it was the wrong thing to do with my account!! This was recorded on XX/XX/2018."
Student loan,I ask navient to prove that I took out the loans. It went to several collection agencies all could not provide me copies of the signed paper work. When this happened Navient went to a different debt collector. I reported this to the credit agency and they removed it from my records and said that Naviant failed to provide them with evidence. And navient just resubmitted these loans as unpayed and late to the credit agencies again. How can they do this.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In the process of purchasing a home my credit report was pulled. To my surprise I had a late reported to my credit by XXXX XXXX for the month of XXXX. I obtained an Auto loan with XXXX XXXX in XXXX  of XX/XX/XXXX. For over 40 months I have made payments on time within a 30day period. On XXXX XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX I called in to make my regular payment OF {$1200.00} to XXXX XXXX, with 5 days remaining in the month. After speaking with their customer service and loan department, I was informed that there was nothing they could do to reverse the late that they reported on my credit. They confirmed that I did call in on the XXXX of XXXX  but they out source the processing of their payments to a company called XXXX which post the payments within 2 business days from which they were made. In my situation they did not post until the 4th business day which was the XXXX  of XXXX, causing me to have a 30 day late on my credit. This is definitely unfair trade practices. I had NO knowledge of their outsourcing and I should not have to suffer from a 30 day late when in fact the payment was made well within that time frame. I am in the process of purchasing a home and this has greatly affected my ability to qualify for a home loan."
Vehicle loan or lease,"In XX/XX/XXXX there was a late payment reported to the credit bureau by ALLY Financial. They reported that the loan was past 30 days late yet I had not received a phone call to notify me that the loan was late. The mobile app is the only way I am able to review my account and make payments. Upon reviewing my account through the app on XX/XX/XXXX it stated the regular payment of {$290.00} was due on XX/XX/XXXX for our first auto loan account as well as {$590.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX on the other auto loan account. The payments for both accounts were made on XX/XX/XXXX ( we have a 10 day grace period for all payments ). After seeing this reported on my credit report I called Ally to correct this problem as I made the payment on time according to the mobile app. They stated they were unsure why the app listed a payment date in XXXX since the payment was actually due in XXXX yet the amount due was only that of a regular payment and did not say there was a past due amount as it should if the payment has lapsed. The same statement appeared on the account in XXXX, telling me the payments were not due until XX/XX/XXXX. Those payments were still made on time. I have screenshots of the app and the incorrect payment due date and have offered to email them to Ally so they can correct this. The representative had stated they can not accept a screenshot of the app. A call was made in XXXX to report this issue and a report was filed with their credit department. I was told they would call me within 30-45 days to update on the issue. I never received a call. I called again in XXXX since the time had lapsed for the report to be reviewed and again they said they would file a report with "" high urgency '' and I would be contacted after the case was reviewed again. Still I did not receive a call. My husband XXXX XXXX who is also on the account called on XX/XX/XXXX to see if he could speak with someone regarding the issue. They stated they never received a call from myself and they were unable to locate the 2 previous reports. He requested to file an additional report with "" high urgency '' and that has been processed. We have not heard back from any representative yet."
Student loan,"Twice since the start of my loan repayment I have had economic hardship. When calling Sallie Mae ( now Navient ), the only options that was given to me was forbearance or deferment. These options caused my overall loan to increase thousands of dollars by the end of the payment term. It has now been over 6-7 years on repayment and somehow many of my account balances are higher than the principle I started out with. Income based repayment was never offered as an option for me and would have been the best option for the financial situation I was in at that time. I feel that Sallie Mae never offered these because they just wanted to make more money off the borrower in the long run. The impact of forbearance or deferments were also never mentioned and proved to be a huge addition to my original loan amount for a couple months of hardship. 

Before my hardships, there were many times where I paid well more than the minimum payment amount. These payments were not allocated in a way that made my payments go down faster and somehow never made a difference after I had to file for forbearance."
Mortgage,"Nationstar Mr. Cooper Mortgage told me I was late on my payments the beginning of XX/XX/2018. I then paid the full amount they required to keep my account active. And we agreed upon an amount to be paid monthly, in a refinanced loan, which I paid on time every month. My loan has been current since XX/XX/2018. I paid every amount they told me to pay. And documents were finalized and signed XX/XX/2018. Nationstar Mr. Cooper was wrong in filing a 60 days late charge on XX/XX/2018, and a 90 days late charge on XX/XX/2018, to the Credit Bureaus. And those charges need to be removed off my credit records."
Debt collection,"SYNCB XXXX, FL XXXX Was not informed about the collection. Account was made without authorization"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX a foreclosure case was opened against me. 

They took auto payments from my account then completely stopped. We went round and round with Loan Modifications, which I accepted all but 1, and after the trial period of me making all the payments on time and in full, XXXX XXXX stated that the Loan Modifications were invalid and they stopped taking payments from me again. This happened at least 4 times over 2 years. The final Loan modification document that XXXX wanted me to sign was for {$150000.00} for 40 years. I rejected this offer as my balance is only {$110000.00} and I only have about 15 years left. This was the last time I was able to communicate with XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX Servicing Legal Department, XXXX XXXX, They stated that XXXX was no longer the servicer ( effective XX/XX/XXXX ) and that my account was closed. I have not received anything from XXXX or the new Service Company. I was informed by XXXX XXXX that the new service company was called XXXX XXXX. I have attempted to contact the new servicer for a payoff request letter and have left multiple messages. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX and left message for the operator. I have still not heard anything back as it goes directly to voicemail. I called XXXX XXXX again and they said that they would request a payoff letter and send it to my email address within 2 business days. They stated that they were waiting for the lender to provide additional information. I am currently still waiting. 

I recently got my evidence of insurance from my homeowners insurance and the mortgage holder is a completely different company than what XXXX and XXXX XXXX attorneys told me. This new company that was listed on my insurance documents was FCI Lender Services , Inc. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted FCI Lender Services , Inc. and they were able to locate my account. I was transferred to an account specialist named XXXX. She stated that the mail that they have sent was being returned as non-deliverable. I updated all contact information with them and provided them my email address and requested them to email me all the statement, documentation, etc that they have been trying to send to me via USPS. XXXX stated that she would send all the documents to my email via secured email. She also said that any payoff request should be in writing and sent via email or fax. XX/XX/XXXX I sent the payoff request letter as instructed. I still have not seen the documents promised to me by my account specialist or any payoff documents. 

Up to today 's date, I have been doing some investigation myself on why it is so hard to provide me a payoff document. What I have found out is that on XX/XX/XXXX, a satisfaction of mortgage was recorded with the County Recorder 's office. Last, in XX/XX/XXXX, all real estate account on my credit report have been closed and show as PAID. Currently I do not have any mortgage listed on my credit report for any of the 3 credit bureaus. This has affected my credit score negatively which is causing huge financial issues.

I believe there is two things happening with my mortgage, first since the country recorder 's office has a satisfaction of mortgage recorded the account is closed/paid-in-full. Second, my mortgage  was flipped and sold to another lender or servicer or sliced up and sold to investors as securitized packages on XXXX XXXX ( This is why XXXX wanted me to sign a new note for 40 years and {$150000.00} ). This should be illegal and some penalties and actions should be taken against lenders and servicers who practice these predatory practices."
Student loan,I logged into my navient account in XX/XX/2018 to make my normal monthly payment as I always do. I was not past due or anything abnormal. I went to make my payment and my total due said {$0.00}. I was very confused as to why it said my monthly payment of {$270.00} was showing nothing due at this time. I decided to call navient to see what was going on. The customer service rep said oh we are giving you a disaster relief forbearance. I was totally confused. I said what was the disaster? She said due to the fires that were currently happening in california they decided to turn off my account and give me 3 months of no payments to help me out. I told her that I did not request this and did not receive any email or letter in the mail about it. I made sure to ask her if I would be penalized for it i chose not to pay within those 3 months or if i would be charged any crazy interest or anything like that. She assured me that my account was completely turned off and it would not be accruing any interest and to resume payments in XXXX as normal. XXXX came around and i logged in and made my normal payment. I made another payment in XXXX as well as XXXX. I go log in this month to make my XXXX payment and I happen to notice that my account balance has not gone down whatsoever. I look at my payment history. For XXXX i paid a remaining balance of {$120.00}. ( i chose to pay {$150.00} in XXXX when my account was turned off ) The entire amount went to interest. For XXXX i made a payment of {$270.00} and the entire amount went to interest. For XXXX i made a payment of {$270.00} and only {$30.00} went to principle. I called navient and asked them why i had made payments totaling {$670.00} and only {$30.00} went to principle. they had responded saying its because my account was turned off and i owe back interest. I told them i spoke to a representative that did not give me the option whether or not to turn off my account and that it was their decision without even informing me and now im being penalized for capital interest. I told them to reverse the charges and they refused. they also told me my loan was extended for 3 months due to the account being turned off. i was furious and they basically told me there was nothing they could do. i feel completely scammed.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The complaint is currently open. XXXX-XXXX. 

Here is the complaint explanation : The partial account number listed on my credit report ( experian ) is XXXX. The last activity on this account was XX/XX/XXXX. This was the last documented time XXXX XXXX XXXX reported this account to the Experian credit agency and then ran out of time legally to collect on this debt per California state law. The statute of limitations in the state of California - where I live - is 4 years. This account is currently out of compliance with the statute of limitations in the state of California. It is against the law for Experian and XXXX  XXXX XXXX to report on this account information after XX/XX/XXXX which is when the statute of limitations on credit collections expired. This is lowering my credit score and causing me illegal pain and suffering economically without a proper legal enforcement of state specific statutes of limitations by the Federal Reserve governing board required to legally regulate the banks and protect consumers. Experian states they will report on this until XX/XX/XXXX as if this is a bankruptcy notation on my credit report and that is not factual and this type of fiction is incorrect. A bankruptcy is reported for 10 years under the fair credit reporting act but revolving credit has different rules and regulations federally and by the consumer 's state of residence. This account was opened in the state of California at XXXX  XXXX XXXX in XXXX. The statute of limitations on collections of a debt in the state of California begin at 4 years after the last credit reporting to Experian. So according to the law - this account expired in XX/XX/XXXX. So i have endured illegal negative credit reporting by both XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Experian credit reports for the last 2 years and counting. I would like this removed immediately from my credit report and a settlement paid to me due to unfair credit reporting practices violating California state law. I would consider an offer of {$1500.00} by XXXX XXXX XXXX to be paid to me in this case for each year that this account is out of compliance with statutes of limitations to be a fair amount. There are numerous resources available to the general consumer who is trying to improve credit ratings by entirely following the law. Statutes of limitations allow a consumer not to pay a debt when following the law. This amount would allow me to repair secured credit with my FDIC insured bank. I am clearly not bankrupted. The reason that {$900.00} - {$1500.00} is needed is because in order to repair secure credit I would have to deposit {$1500.00} with my FDIC insured bank so that when maintaining brake work on my XXXX XXXX XXXX I could use a secured credit card to pay {$400.00} in timely payments on a {$1500.00} credit limit while only using about 26 % of my allocated credit limit. This is one way to improve credit scores and ratings by never exceeding 30 % of one 's allocated credit limits. XXXX  XXXX XXXX needs to be punished for not protecting or teaching customers how to improve credit scores while blatantly disregarding state specific laws. My resources for credit improvement include books by XXXX XXXX as well as many resources available through my counties public library. It is my understanding that the entire role of the federal reserve bank board is to literally govern banks and hold them accountable to the rules and regulations of fair credit reporting practices."
Checking or savings account,"In XX/XX/2018, I went to check on my {$15000.00} CD account with Bank of America. I have evidence of this account for several years, then tax reports stopped. I did not withdraw the money. However, they could find the account number, but no funds. Their research and investigation department searched for it twice and could not find the money, nor any documentation of what happened to it. They sent me a letter that this investigation case is now closed as of XX/XX/18. 

I obviously want my {$15000.00} plus the interest earned for all these years. 

I have checked twice with the State and they do not have it as unclaimed money.

Recently I found out that I was put into the wrong program for qualifying payments. After paying back about {$14000.00} dollars in student loans, It shows that I have only had 6 qualifying payments. SIX!! I did the math and based on my current monthly payments, it calculates to about 70 qualifying payments. I tried to call the phone number and they said that I wasn't in the correct repayment plan. They knew I was a XXXX and they placed me in the wrong program. I tried calling the Department of Education ; still no help.

I checked my account balance at Navient 's website and the loan I negotiated a settlement for over six months ago still appears as due with a balance. Worried that I may have negotiated with the wrong party I contacted Navient and was informed that they do not update information for "" delinquent '' loans. The operator then identified a different debt collector than the one I negotiated with for the loan and question and could not answer my questions about the legitimacy of the company I was bargaining with. When I questioned how I, as a consumer, am supposed to make informed decisions about my finances when the company that services my loans will not give me accurate information the operator repeated that this was their policy. I have two lawsuits against me by a debt collector that Navient does not identify as the legitimate debt collector for my loan. What am I to do?"
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","XX/XX/2018 I closed my checking account with Bank of America - He had me get 2 cashier checks for {$4000.00} he told me to separate the top part from the bottom & put them in different places in case the checks were stolen. He said if they were stolen that I could get them cashed with the check stubs. 

That night I left them in my pant pockets when I went to bed. In the morning they were missing - the only objects stolen in my apartment. 

Now they won't put a stop payment on the checks or honor the debt"

Mortgage,"SunTrust bought my mortgage. I tried to set up recurring payments online. I accidentally went on the 'one time payment ' page and when I realized it I tried to cancel and go to the 'recurring payment ' page. It asked if I wanted to cancel and I clicked 'yes '. Then I set up a recurring payment. It was then that I realized SunTrust had taken two payments. My wife and I have spent several hours this week trying to get the second payment back by jumping through all of the hoops SunTrust required to prove the transaction happened-DESPITE THE FACT SUNTRUST SENT US NOTIFICATIONS THAT IT HAD RECIEVED BOTH PAYMENTS!!!! I even went to a branch of the bank from which the funds were transferred ( XXXX XXXX ) and got a printed statement and a signed letter from a bank manager stating that the funds has been dispersed. Today I called SunTrust and they told to me to fax them the documents. After redacting everything on the XXXX XXXX statement - except my name, account number, and the transaction amounts to SunTrust - I faxed it to them. A representative just called back and said they wouldn't refund my overpayment unless the document showed my checking account balance after each of the transactions to make sure it wasn't a negative balance. I asked why, if they had received both payments, they would care if it was a negative balance ( XXXX, it was not a negative balance ). She couldn't answer that. I said that was private information between me and my bank and was none of SunTrust 's business - ESPECIALLY since they had received and deposited both payments. I asked if she would want to show a third party any balances on her banking accounts. She answered, "" Yes, if I wanted to get my money back. '' Isn't that called blackmail? I sent them the information they requested but I feel that they have gone way too far with this request/issue by delving into my personal information they have no right to. I have now XXXX SunTrust and am shocked by the number and scope of the complaints against this bank. If I was rich I would pay off this mortgage right now just so I would never have to hear/see the name of this unscrupulous bank ever again!"

I immediately called the company and spoke to customer service and told them that my original payments were only {$310.00} prior to any transfers at 6.8 % interest why did my "" loan forgiveness '' payments go up? I was told that my problem would be referred to their account problem department. I never received any correspondence. The next month my payment remained at {$340.00}. I called again and was told that they do see my prior request and would request again. Now my 3rd payment is still {$340.00}.

I have been making my credit card payments in the same way for the last year and never had this problem. I called the company and was told to use XXXX XXXX as the web browser. I got the same message from that browser. I called the company back and was simply told they are not aware of any problems. The customer service person stated there was nothing wrong with the company web site or security. The person didn't even want to forward my information to IT. The company should look into the insecurity of their system and advise customers.

I went back there to bring up the fact that they didn't fix items that I paid for, certain things weren't dry cleaned, and my pants were lost. They told me that they gave me my pants, but it must have fallen on the ground when I was walking, but that made no sense. 

I filed a claim with my bank because these are not the services I paid for, and they lost my pants. My bank denied my claim."
Student loan,There was no completion to the complaint or investigation into a resolution. I have called every week for 90 days and sent 2 letters certified mail. The lender came back with a response to the issuance of the loan being given to me in an inept state. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has stated that an individual who doesnt complete high school or the equivalent is not prepared for the task of understanding the debt that will accrue in college. Their response to me filing paperwork supporting this happened was that I stated on my forms applying for the loan i checked a box stating I had graduate high school or its equivalent. I checked the box without understanding that a high school graduate even needed a diploma. Not only did I not graduate high school I only went to a year and a half of school my entire life through XXXX.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Before I had my medical bills, and prior to purchasing a home, I had asked USAA to raise my credit limit above {$5000.00} ; which they declined ( This was roughly 4-5 years ago ). Now that I have had a few ER visits with very high bills over the past 4-4.5 years USAA has continually raised my credit limit, without my consent, and my debt keeps rising. In the past I have been able to mitigate what I owed on my credit card considerably with bonuses and tax returns ; however, over the last year I have been in the ER multiple times and had various car expenses and now my debt has become out of control. As of this date I currently owe {$8400.00} and have available credit of {$3400.00}, which is absurd for someone in my situation ( I am a single father who pays child support and who owns a home ). I tried to call USAA several different times and the most recent time ( XX/XX/18 ) I was bounced around from department to department whilst trying to reach a representative to work with me on lowering my interest rate and figuring out a payment plan and the ultimately reducing my credit limit and placing a cap on said credit limit so this does not happen again. After a long time on the phone with rude representatives I was told the wouldn't access my account and I would have to call back later ( I have a recording of that conversation ). I submitted a complaint to the XXXX ( # XXXX ) and I was called once by XXXX XXXX XXXX of Member Advocacy from the Office of the CEO within USAA that I missed at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was promptly sent an email stating that said individual was unable to contact me at XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Due to the butched up involvement of this very institution, after I HAD DENIED A CHARGE OF INSTANT CASH WITHRAWAL, Citybank had failed to remove that charge from my bill so I had asked this institution to UPHOLD FEDERAL LAWS OF A DISPUTED CREDIT TRANSACTION!! This institution failed to assist in complying with federal credit laws!! 

Now, Citybank had claimed to close the disputed account, and WITHOUT ANY APPROVAL they opened a second and a third account ADDING THE DISPUTED INSTANT CASH WITHRAWAL TO THE NEW ACCOUNTS, completely without my approval at all!! When contacted Citybank, they claimed that the accounts WERE OPENED BY THE XXXX IN XXXX, their security division. This is became a nightmare by a RUGE BANK who disseminates credit and personal information to a FOREIGN COUNTRY which has no duty to comply with US LAWS and able to do anything with the information of a US customer, citizen, without any recourse by the very citizen.

I demand US Attorney General to review Citybank 's conducts and assess the highest fines available to a RUGE BANK, repeatedly violating US credit laws!!"
Mortgage,"To sum up what has transpired with myself and Third Federal is I have been making payments just about all on time to them for ten years. About four years ago I filed bankrupcy because I was a single mom and full-time XXXX student. In that time I had always paid my bills to Thhird Federal on time. After the bankrupcy my loan was discharged but I continued to pay because of course I want my house. This has been at least the third time I have received threatening letters from Third Federal as well as them putting a delinquency on my credit report which I have rebuilt. For most of my loan I had paid approximately {$55.00} a month. Apparently after bankrupcy they raised it slightly yet they never informed me. They stated when I called that they are not allowed to send me bills even though I was rerquesting them so I can stay on top of paying them, yet they refused. I paid the outstanding portion I had owed because i was never made aware of the increase. Then about a year later they send me another threatening letter that I am delinquent because of non payment yet I said I have made all my payments. The rep said my loan amount increased and I owed {$220.00} extra, I asked if they could inform me so this does not happen again and they refused. I had made a complaint with you but nothing transpired. I did pay the difference immediately and that was approximately six months ago. Again, I continued to make monthly payments on time which I have enclosed a copy of. Now six months later they send me another threatening notice saying I owe {$450.00} and this letter is a notice of default on my mortgage loan reference # XXXX resulting from my failure to make all monthly installments due as of XX/XX/18. I HAVE made all payments, they continue to reck havoc on my credit and my mortgage, I am trying to rebuild the excellent credit I had had yet they continue to sabatoge it as if to forclose my house and get their money. My loan is approximately {$23000.00} and I had for the most part paid $ XXXX/month, then this year I find out it had gone up to about {$74.00}, the actual amount I am uncertain of whereas they continue to refuse to inform me. I have paid the $ {$220.00} owed plus the $ XXXX   monthly, it is impossible that I could owe {$450.00} in six months when I have made AL, again ALL of my payments. This is harassment and sabotage to my home and welfare. It has got to end. They need to remove that {$450.00} and from now on send a written estimate of my payments and what I owe. They can not continue to send me frivolous bills of outrages sums without any explanation. I can not even go online to review anything, I have no idea what they are doing, what they are charging me or what my interest rate is. I believe if I aim making and have made all my payments for ten years I am entitled to receive a bill, a reason for owing {$450.00}. This is UNACCEPTABLE. They are trying to forclose on my home."
Debt collection,This company contacted me by mail stating that I owed a debt from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I have no knowledge of this debt & this debt isn't shown anywhere on my credit report. However back in XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX I did have XXXX XXXX that eventually ended up in collections but that was settled last year. I've sent letters to Pressler & Plessler LLC as well as the court. I've also asked them to send me valid proof of this debt in a letter via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX & I haven't gotten a response from them until now. They sent me another letter recently stating wage garnishment but still haven't shown me the proof that I've requested.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/2017 I registered a PayPal account which I planned to use to accept payments for items sold on XXXX. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I received payments to my account for said sold items. My PayPal account had a limitation placed on it as a result which at a later time became a permanent limitation after 180 days passed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating my PayPal funds were eligible for withdrawal. However, I have not been able to log into my account to withdraw these funds. I receive an error message when trying to log in and am not able to log into my account to access these funds. When calling your regular customer support no one was able to figure out what the problem is. When submitting a XXXX complaint against you previously, I received a response asking me to upload ID, Bank Statement, Credit Card Statement, Proof of Address, and Business Registration Information. I expressed several concerns about this at the time but by concerns were completely ignored. 

I have told PayPal multiple times that I do not own a business thus there is no business information that can be provided for the business information documents requested. The only reason I upgraded my account to a business account was because I was told to do so by a PayPal representative when I was having issues accepting payments initially. I was told that upgrading my personal account to a business account should enable me to receive payments. And the issue receiving payments was resolved after the upgrade. You can see that the business name I set on my account was simply my first name "" XXXX '' and is clearly not the name of an actual business. Let me say this again since no one who I have talked to previously has been able to comprehend this : I DO NOT OWN A BUSINESS! 

I have previously raised concerns about how PayPal classifies themselves as a banking institution and PayPal 's actions when dealing with my account are a clear violation of banking laws. Not only because normal banks are not allowed to hold money for 180 days or more, but because banks are not allowed to place stipulations on releasing money and then confiscate the money if those stipulations aren't meant like PayPal is trying to do. In addition to the fact that instead of normal banking procedure which calls for documents to be provided BEFORE an account is opened if they are going to be asked for, PayPal waited until after the account was opened and had already accepted payments before requesting these documents as a condition of allowing me to withdraw my own money. PayPal seems to think this is a plus for customers that they don't ask for documents before sign up but really it's extremely shady. But then I found out that PayPal is registered as a money transmitter in Washington ( my state of residence ) and not a bank so PayPal can then argue they are not bound by banking laws. 

Okay, then you are in violation of Washington 's money transmitter laws. Washington 's money transmitter laws state "" Every money transmitter licensee and its authorized delegates shall transmit the monetary equivalent of all money or equivalent value received from a customer for transmission, net of any fees, or issue instructions committing the money or its monetary equivalent, to the person designated by the customer within ten business days after receiving the money or equivalent value, unless otherwise ordered by the customer ... '' 180 days is quite a bit longer than the 10 business day legal limit for holding money according to this statue. Let alone continuing to hold the money afterwards. I attached an image that shows this statue in Washington 's money transmitter laws. 

In addition, PayPal has provided 2 different methods to send documents to them : via email to XXXX or via fax to ( XXXX ) XXXX. I have proof that PayPal doesn't respond to correspondence sent to either of these sources. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX about this issue. 8 DAYS later on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response that didn't address my issue. The following day on XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a reply explaining this and have received no responses since. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a fax to PayPal 's fax number ( as more of a test just to see if PayPal would respond ) with a brief letter explaining my problem and asking for an explanation of why I was locked out of my account. I left the PayPal email registered to my account to receive any replies. To this date, I have received no reply. So even if documents were sent to either of these sources, it seems the chances are slim that anyone would actually see the documents. And even if they did, they may or may not be in a position where they understand the issue or can assist. So STOP TELLING ME TO SEND DOCUMENTS TO THESE PLACES. YOU DON'T MONITOR EITHER OF THESE SOURCES. Plus also, XXXX despite their response not addressing my issue, simply said my funds would be held for 180 days. They mentioned nothing about having to upload documents after 180 days. I will attach images of the emails and faxes sent. The only time PayPal ever responds to me besides calling the XXXX number ( which is a complete joke ) is when I file a complaint against them. This is unacceptable and complete XXXX. 

PayPal 's request for documents also poses an unnecessary risk to my personal information and possible identity theft. I am aware that the PayPal subsidiary XXXX was involved in a data breach affecting XXXX XXXX customers. See here : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX And PayPal is currently dealing with a class action lawsuit related to this breach. You can say all you want that you take privacy and data security seriously but you know that you can not provide 100 % assurance that any documents provided to you by customers will not end up being hacked/stolen or otherwise end up in the wrong hands. What's stopping one of your own employees from taking these documents and using them to apply for a line of credit in that customer 's name? It's especially not secure to send documents when you're asking them to be sent through unsecured emails or to an insecure fax number. Why don't you send me all of your documents so I can verify you are who you say you are? If you think it poses no risk at all to you? You can upload them as attachments in your response to this complaint. 

If you wish to cite any loopholes in your user agreement that supposedly make this practice of holding funds indefinitely legal, I would like to point out that terms and conditions in a company 's contract that are deemed illegal are not enforceable in a court of law. For instance, a federal court has previously ruled that PayPal 's arbitration clause is not enforceable. See here : XXXX XXXX XXXX A review of PayPal 's user agreement indicates that despite this ruling, the arbitration clause is still present. So honestly, I don't give a XXXX what your agreement says. And apparently the courts don't either. This company is shady. They want to build their terms of service so they can basically do anything they want without regard to the law. And then try to take away a customer 's ability to challenge PayPal 's practices in court. I'll bet PayPal has many other terms that would be deemed unenforceable if challenged in a court of law. Also, why does it say in your recently added terms that even if your identity hasn't been verified you can still withdraw money? You just can't send it or use it to make purchases. But you're trying to tell me that you need to verify my identity before I can withdraw my money. You're contradicting your own policies right there. I'll upload this part of your user agreement too. 

Something else I noticed when doing some searching on this company, Why are 95 % of the comments about PayPal on your social media negative? 95 % is probably giving you the benefit of the doubt by the way. You do realize that's not normal right? Pretty much everyone on your social media pages has some complaint about PayPal. Very few people say good things about this company. I also found several users who commented describing an issue with their PayPal account very similar to mine. Including 1 user who has had their account locked by PayPal for over 15 months. And don't even get me started on the information about PayPal from this site : XXXX XXXX XXXX granted some of this information is outdated like 70 % of PayPal 's cash flow being generated by XXXX. But much of this is still applicable today. Aside from your sketchy ways of asking for documents through insecure means and being involved in data breaches, anyone should be concerned about supplying documents to a company that has your kind of ethics. Any website which allows people to review PayPal needs to implement an option to give negative stars. 1 star is way too good for this company. XXXX XXXX  PAYPAL."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I am a senior citizen and a little over a month and a half ago, I attended a little seminar by a XXXX.

After six sessions, I found I was getting no relief and my problems with my XXXX were getting worse. I told the girl XXXX at the front desk that I did not want to be billed in advance of my sessions. Instead, through Care Credit, I was billed XXXX when I only saw this doctor six times and I paid for the initial visit out of pocket.

I never wanted to be billed for the full amount ahead of time. Care Credit my account ends in XXXX, said they would contact the provider. I said I got no relief and I received no detailed invoices from each visit showing what was billed to XXXX, etc. I requested this information more than once.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","After not being able to resolve my issue with Experian, regarding my credit score, I submitted a complaint via the CFPB. Experian did respond, but with a generic letter confirming my score should NOT have been impacted. Please review my previous complaint, along with the feedback notes. Since the "" rules of what does not impact a credit score '' clearly states "" where I live '' ( I have lived at the same address 10 years ) should not impact my score and nothing has changed other than paying my bills on time, my score should have been corrected accordingly. I spoke to a CFPB representative after seeing the response and she agreed I should resubmit, since Experian has verified my score should not have been impacted, yet failed to correct the matter."

I have currently made a total of 8 payments and they have reneged on their promise. I have asked this company repeatedly to put me in another vehicle or lower my current interest rate.

Since this has not happened I want to do a voluntary repossession.

Checking or savings account,"I filed for a small personal loan through what a I thought was a legitimate loan company "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' based out of California. I received a telephone call from the "" representative '' clarifying the information on the application. In going over the information, the representative stated that he had my bank password, which he proceeded to tell me. Surprisingly, he did in fact have my password. At no time, did I provide my password to him. He transferred money from one account to another, making it appear that the loan was granted. However, TD Bank is stating that fraud was not committed as they are stating that I willingly gave the password to the caller and authorized the three separate transactions."

Ms. XXXX XXXX at best abused her authority to order checks I did not desire plus charged those checks to my account.

Also on the papers it stated that they filed against me on XX/XX/XXXX why did I receive the paperwork without an envelope on XX/XX/XXXX. This just can not be right. My home for XXXX years is about to be taken from under me and I just do not know what to do at this point."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX. This is our XXXX XXXX in the last 9 years. For the first time I was getting close to the miles. Visited XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX trying to get a solution becuase didnt want to go over the miles. None of them advicsd me that it would be better to pay the extra miles than getting a new car at the moment. None of them were able to work deal that made financial sense to me. At the end I decided to return the car and pay the XXXX remaining of the lease. At the time I received the first bill XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Hyundai Motor Financial and told asked them to wave the XXXX early termination fee so I can pay the difference Since a new need for a Hybrid came up I wanted to stay with the branch and with the Ioniq I can get a tax credit. At that time the ioniq wasnt available, I made an initial payment of XXXX to my account. The representative told me he will extend the due date until XX/XX/XXXX until the car became available. XX/XX/XXXX was here and the car I wanted wasnt available, At the moment paid another XXXX requested the fee to be refunded and was declined again. Asked the representative if paying after XX/XX/XXXX will affect my credit her asnwer was that everything stay in house and an internal recovery department will contact me. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX a collection agency asking me all my information. I wasn't comfortable answering and the agent told me they will send a letter. That letter came in a week letter and than in XX/XX/XXXX the agent call me again. When he was asking my verification questions he told me he cant talk to me because my date of birth didn't match his records he had XX/XX/XXXX and my DOB is XX/XX/XXXX he promise a call when fixed. On XX/XX/XXXX he calls me back telling me they corrected the information and we can now talk. I told him that I will pay the invoice completely because I didn't want to affect my perfect payment history I have built for the last 12 years. He told me is to late because in XX/XX/XXXX I was reported to the credit bureaus with a delinquent account. I wasn't happy XX/XX/XXXX was the day he couldn't verify me over the phone because of their mistake. I told him I will pay when they remove that negative mark from my credit. He talked to his supervisor and told me they will do and exception and email Hyundai to get that off my credit in exchange I have to pay in full. 
It is now XX/XX/XXXX and I haven't receive a call back, the mark still in my records, I called then 3 times and are always with a high call volume. I emailed Hyundai Motor Finance and they directed me to recovery who directed me to that XXXX number. 
This is not the first time HMF damaged us."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I closed a USAA credit card account on XX/XX/XXXX after I received the XXXX statement which closed on XXXX/XXXX. This statement included the following : "" ...

'' I called the number and cancelled the account on XX/XX/XXXX. In early XX/XX/XXXX, I received the XXXX statement which closed on XX/XX/XXXX and which included the {$40.00} which was posted on XX/XX/XXXX. 


On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a USAA credit card representative who stated that the {$40.00} fee was unavoidable since I had closed the account 5 days after the fee was posted. 

So it seems I paid a yearly XXXX fee for a USAA rewards credit card, even though I cancelled it in good faith."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, the car was in the shop for over 40 days getting the faulty motor replaced. In XX/XX/XXXX it was "" Presumed '' a Lemon and GM on XX/XX/XXXX offered a Collateral Trade. This trade was contingent upon getting my lender to agree to the trade. Since that time I have called GM Financial on many occasions, explaining what I needed. They would note my account pass me on to various department and no further action would be taken. Occasionally I would get someone who had some idea of what department could help me, and I would hold for long periods of time just to hit a dead end. Someone would give me another phone number to call which just got me to the same main line. In XX/XX/XXXX of this year, my Dealer Rep. XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX received instruction from GM Financial to complete a collateral trade info packet and fax it to them. After faxing it two different time, we had confirmation that the package was received and they would contact me when they were ready to move forward. After numerous emails to XXXX XXXX in Loss Mitigation, XXXX responded on XX/XX/XXXX and said she could initiate the dealer exchange process, as long as I understood that they would NOT issue any funds for the exchange, which I agreed that I did not expect them to do that. On XX/XX/XXXX my attorney who is representing me for the Lemon Law negotiation submitted a Letter of Representation to GM Financial per their request before they would talk to him. Following that GM Financial will not talk to me since I have representation, however they also are returning calls to my attorney and we are unable to get any status updates or answers. General Motors has now closed my claim due to no action and my attorney is indicating he can't complete the transaction he negotiated because my lender is non responsive, but he needs to be paid since the attorney fees due to him were built into the lemon law case. 

The dealership and my attorney have provided GM Financial with all the requested documentation that they have been asked for in a very timely manner, then told that they would initiate the trade approval, and since then nothing, which could now cost me thousands of dollars in attorney fees because my lender refuses to give approval on what is obviously a good deal for my loan. A XXXX XXXX clearly holds a higher value than a XXXX XXXX with XXXX miles on it."

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/18 I opened a Capital One 360 account using the promo code XXXX. The terms and conditions clearly stated that in order to be eligible you would have to deposit at least {$50000.00} into your account. There are no terms outlining a requirement of a {$50000.00} balance or a single deposit totaling {$50000.00}. The terms and conditions of the offer can be found at : https : //www.capitalone.com/savings500/. 


Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I made deposits of {$11000.00}, {$15000.00}, {$15000.00}, {$10000.00}, and {$1100.00}. These deposits totaled {$52000.00}. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out with a representative via Capital One 's online chat service. He assured me that I did meet the qualifications of the bonus, and that it would post 60 days from XX/XX/XXXX, which would be XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached the transcript of that conversation. 


On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Capital One 's customer service telephone line to check on the status of my bonus. On my phone call, I was told that they could not honor the bonus. I politely asked to escalate the call to a manager. The manager once again told me that she could not post the bonus. I read the terms to the manager from their website, and she acknowledged that the terms and conditions did not state a requirement for a {$50000.00} total balance. She said that their marketing team had since updated the terms for future offers. She said that while it was not in the terms and conditions, it was "" The spirit of the offer '' to only post to accounts holding total balances of {$50000.00} I politely explained to her what the representative told me in XXXX about the account being eligible. She then put me on a brief hold, and offered to post a {$100.00} bonus. I politely refused, and hung up. I believe Capital One knows that they did not put this stipulation in their terms and conditions, and is know refusing to post the promised bonus."
Checking or savings account,"Please reference your prior claim ID XXXX. Shortly after submitting that claim I received an apologetic letter from XXXX XXXX at the executive response unit of Citibank N.A. in XXXX XXXX. Please see your CC in file.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX I used XXXX through my mobile bank app with Bank of America to transfer money to another Bank of America customer in the amount of {$500.00} because it claims it is a secure way to send money. The transfer had the first name of the person I was sending it to and the message stated car payment. I noticed a couple of hours later, that same day that the phone number I inputted was incorrect. I immediately contacted my Bank to get this transaction reversed and the representative I spoke to said to call the following day because no one in the transfer department was there. I called the next morning onXX/XX/XXXX again and another representative from Bank of America told me that due to the holiday (XX/XX/XXXX ) I now had to wait until Tuesday XX/XX/ to make a claim. Tuesday I called Bank of America again and they stated that the transaction can not be cancelled or reversed since it was already processed but they will do an investigation that could take up to 14 days. No correspondence was sent regarding this matter so I went to my local branch in XXXX, CA to inquire about my claim. The person there said they can not look up any information regarding mobile transfers and just gave me a phone number to call. On XX/XX/ I received a letter from Bank of America 's Dispute Resolution Department stating they had completed their investigation and their records indicate that they initiated the transfer in accordance with my instructions and my account will not be credited. On XX/XX/ another letter was sent to me from Bank of America stating to contact the party directly for further assistance. I called Bank of America again and they notified me that the money was sent to a XXXX XXXX customer and they refused to authorize the money to be returned to my account. I inquired about the name of the person who the money was sent to and they said they could not give me that information but said if I want to pursue further I can file a police report. I filed a police report and contacted Bank of America again with the police report number but they refuse to resolve this situation."
Mortgage,"I have filed several complaints against Wells Fargo, and the opposing counsel, Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, has committed several legal violations. For example, he has severely violated his oath as an Attorney in the state of California, and is totally corrupt. Again, he has issued me a fraudulent document which consisted of a mortgage note that was falsified due to the fact that it did not match the original copy of the mortgage note. In addition, Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX has been indulging in dual-tracking while a loan modification was in progress, sending me direct emails, and letters instead of communication with my legal counsel. In addition, Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to have someone deliver personal papers to my next door neighbor that consisted of information regarding the status of the subject property, and was discussing the foreclosure attempts regarding the property with a friend of mine who is an Attorney, but is not my legal counsel. My neighbor told the individual at the door never to come back to his home again. The auction of the subject property is scheduled for XX/XX/2019, and Attorney XXXX XXXX, has not offered any alternatives to the foreclosure process. Finally, Attorney XXXX XXXX needs to lose his license to practice law in the state of California."
Debt collection,"For a number of months, I've been receiving several calls daily during the week from the same phone number. This phone number changes on a weekly basis. The caller name NEVER appears and the caller NEVER leaves a message. I have never answered these calls. 

When I XXXX these phone numbers the source is always 'National Credit Adjusters ', supposedly a debt collection agency. I have NO debt and have maintained a consistently high credit score for many years. I monitor my credit report through several credit monitoring agencies and in addition to no debt, there have been NO inquiries on my credit record. I'm not sure how they got my phone number, but this is obviously a case of mistaken identity. 

This so-called company does not identify itself or leave phone messages. Based upon the comments of others, National Credit Adjusters attempts to verbally intimidate consumers into paying non-existent debts, debts they no longer owe, or far more than the amount owed. During the summer, your agency received a settlement of hundreds of thousands of dollars from National Credit Adjusters company for engaging in unlawful debt collection acts and practices that harmed consumers. I have no intention of communicating with them and becoming their latest victim. 

I want these phone calls stopped. It would be nice if the company could be put out of business for good."
Student loan,"On XX/XX/2018, I mailed a letter to Great Lakes loan. In the letter I asked to make extra payments in exchange for the letter of indebtedness. The letter of indebtedness is the Mastery Promissory Note. I have doubts about this loan and whether or not it belongs to me. Great Lakes responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2018, informing me of the numerous options for paying the loan. Then Great Lakes loan suggested that I logon to student loans.gov to obtain the Mastery Promissory Note.

I did what Great Lakes loan suggested and I logged on to  studentloans.gov. I clicked on Mastery Promissory Note which read No Record Found. I mailed a second letter on XX/XX/2018, asking again for the letter of indebtedness ( Mastery Promissory Note ). Also I attached my results found on student loans.gov. Great Lakes response dated XX/XX/2018, saying they need clarification of what Im asking for. I believe that Great Lakes loan is giving me the runaround about the Mastery Promissory Note. I cant seem to get a straight answer with them. I want proof that I owe this loan. I want to see the alleged signature that I signed."

Mortgage,"I have a home equity loan that reset to more than double the initial payment. The loan has a variable rate and keeps rising as the Fed razes rates. This loan has all the ear-marks of a predator loan. 

The lender, Bank of America, is not consistent in mailing monthly invoice. I call asking for an invoice to be mailed to me and I am told it is a courtesy.

How do I determine what to pay each money?

I tried applying for a loan modification a couple of years ago. I was assigned a case manager, Mr. XXXX XXXX. He was as Not, very courteous with me badgering me, curt in his replies and not even keeping our phone appointments to keep me apprised of the progress. 

Finally, I was fat out denied the modification. 

Recently, I received notification of a due date change to he XXXX from the XXXX. See the last invoice I got and the change letter. 

I am struggling now and have to wait til I receive retirement benefits to make the payment which is already late. 

How can they change the due date we have already agreed to and implemented for several months???"
Credit card or prepaid card,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I live in XXXX Iowa. On XX/XX/2018 I put {$24.00} of gas in a XXXX XXXX XXXX near to XXXX on the XXXX  XXXX, using my credit card ending XXXX of Bank of America. Then on XX/XX/2018 when I tried to used again in other place, it just said declined. When I checked my card statement it showed that I had done different transactions during XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2018 that I didn't. They were 2 more in the same XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$24.00} and {$13.00} and later three additional transactions in XXXX XXXX {$13.00}, XXXX {$8.00} and XXXX {$27.00}. So it looked they kept doing it Up to my credit limit was reached. Fortunately I just have {$300.00} because they would stealing my money. Once I realized what happened I immediately report to the bank and the create the fraud claim XXXX. On XX/XX/2018, the Bank sent me the letter telling me that there not identified fraudulent transactions and I would have to payback those transitions and I'll be responsible for the balance of my account ( Attached ). On XX/XX/2018 I went to the office in XXXX XXXX and they didn't take my request, because the credit line people weren't working that day. The advisor reschedule an appointment for me during the week days and hours that apparently the credit line people work, but I work and for me is not possible attend a personal appointment that fit in their schedule. Anyway I let The advisor know about my position of not paying those fraudulent transactions, because I never unprotected my card and the bank must be responsible for the card and money care. He explained me no balance will be applied. So since it was a prepaid card I pay for the balance of the money that I really spent, in the way to using for a road trip during XXXX XXXX weekend. I was traveling on my way back from XXXX XXXX to XXXX Iowa confident with my money in my prepaid card, but nevertheless the bank took the money and applied the balance without my authorization. Making me live hard times without my money to put gas, I really faced an emergency because I just counted with the money in my card."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX three transactions were made from XXXX and XXXX. PayPal approved these transactions, while XXXX available balance was {$0.00}. They then went on to charging my XXXX XXXX checking account, which was also at a {$0.00} balance. So although PayPal balance was not enough, because again it was at a {$0.00} balance, amd my XXXX account DECLINED, PayPal decided to approve these transactions. Now before I proceed I should mention these transactions were NOT approved or done by ME, XXXX XXXX. Nor do I know who made these purchases. I have checked my XXXX account and can see the two purchases totaling {$36.00}, one for {$27.00} and the other for {$9.00}. I have received one of the many things ordered. 

Now, my problem is PayPal is attempting to charge these items over and over again, causing my XXXX account to fall in the negative balance of {$220.00}, ALL which is NSFs. The payment will not go through because I dont allow my account to be overdrafted. 

PayPal approved these transactions knowing there was no funds, because Im am pretty darn sure they wont approve a transaction made through them if there is no money. Just like using your debit card at the store and it not having funds. I sumbitted a complaint with PayPal and their response was this is not an unauthorized transaction which is partly true, because although I didnt authorize it, PayPal did. 

Now I dont want or need the items purchased on XXXX, but will pay them, since my PayPal account is also negative due to these purchases. I can also return them, although I havent received all the items, but that wont pay the NSFs and will take weeks to return. 

Secondly the XXXX purchase for {$3.00} should of also been declined but again I will pay that. 

And all of these items show as paid with PayPal balance, and shows my XXXX as back up. I dont understand why XXXX is involved. 
I just want all those fees to be taken care off and for PayPal to close my account when all of this is over. I am very disappointed with their customer service, they made me feel like a liar and a thief, when in all honesty they are the crooks."
Debt collection,"This company continues to report an unauthorized account. Ive sent debt validation letters, Ive disputed this and somehow this account is continually verified as accurate. The only thing Ive recieved from these people is a photocopied bill. Nothing with a signature, nothing that shows proof that I own this debt. I want this unverified account removed from both my XXXX  and XXXX report."
Checking or savings account,"During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase on XXXX mistakenly using the wrong card ( debit card ). This was for ~ {$1400.00}. I immediately cancelled the transaction, received notice that a refund was processed, and called the bank to avoid an overdraft scenario. US Bank informed me that it would be no problem whatsoever. I was relieved. By that Friday XX/XX/2018, my bank account had adjusted, the charge was removed, and relevant OD charge was also removed. Great, I have a positive balance in my account, and it reflects this online on Friday, and over the weekend. However, on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, the charge has re-emerged, and is charged first before several bills that are set to be removed from my account. The first thing I did was transfer money to compensate for the bills. On Tuesday, when everything adjusts again. I am left with 3x {$36.00} OD fees, and a reversed {$1400.00} transaction, leaving me overdrawn by {$80.00}. They purposely manipulated my transaction history, re-applying an already reversed charge in order to justify charging my erroneous OD fees. The only reason Im at a negative {$80.00} balance is from {$100.00} in OD fees. This is deceptive and cruel."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I received three emails from Wester Union confirming transfers. This instantly alarmed me because I did not send any money via Western Union.  The last time I used their online service was in XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately checked my bank account and seen that two of the three transactions went through, however, my bank immediately reversed them. I informed my bank about the unauthorized transactions and cancelled the card that was used. I then called Western Union to notify them of this unauthorized transaction completed on the website and to request my online account be closed. The first person I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX - I explained the situation and she said she would transfer me - I listened to a silence ( call was still connected ) for a few minutes before I hung up and tired again. This time I called their Fraud line XXXX @ XXXX. I explained the situation again to the guy on the phone and I informed him that thankfully the bank stopped the transactions. But I was concerned how this happened on their online platform, and wanted to make the company aware of this and have them look into it. However, he did not acknowledge my complaint. He just stated that my account would be closed. I stressed that they need to look into how this happened. He would not confirm that would be done. I ended my call very frustrated and will never use their services. I also went online to ensure my Western Union online account was closed, as the rep stated it would be, but it was not. 

These are the transactions that were not authorized by me : Your tracking number ( MTCN ) is : XXXX Your tracking number ( MTCN ) is : XXXX Your tracking number ( MTCN ) is : XXXX"
Student loan,"I currently called XXXX on XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18, to try and get a forbearance for my loans because I became unemployed and they are absolutely no help. They told me that I only get 2 month increments on my loan for a forbearance and then I have to pay for 9 months in order to get another forbearance. They do not assist their customers in their time of need. I have always paid and just can not make a payment while receiving unemployment, paying rent, food and utilities. I am a single mother with a XXXX year old. Someone needs to look into their lending practices because they are horrible."
Student loan,"I've had two major issues arise from Navient 's mishandling of my loan 's forbearance paperwork. One is that they claim my account was not in forbearance for a two month period and do not have records of the paperwork. Two is that they put this on my credit report as a missed payment for each of my 5 loans for two months totaling 10 late payments on my report. Navient has refused to correct this when contacted and claims they are in the right. 

1. These late payments vary across the bureaus but on XXXX  it shows XXXX and XX/XX/2014 and on XXXX it shows XXXX and XX/XX/2014. This is all around the same time period Navient split from Salle Mae and in all likelihood mishandled my forbearance. 
2. The first late payment is listed as a 90-119 day late and the second is listed as a 120-149 day late. How is that possible if the proceeding months are listed as current? 

3. Navient applied a late payment to each of my loans separately showing a total of 10 missed payments across two actual missed payments which should not of been shown as missed in the first place. This has been detrimental to my credit report and prevented me from placing my own name on the mortgage of my own house due to high interest not to mention my car loans high interest as well. I verified this when I disputed these payments and the loans temporary came off increasing my credit by 80 points! Only to go back down once they were re-added to my credit report."

Vehicle loan or lease,"In XX/XX/2017 I became a payment behind it is due the XXXX of each month and I paid it on the first of the following month which made in the area of 15- 16 days late. They have been charging me a late fee of XXXX each month i have done this. I had no problem paying the late fee but around XX/XX/XXXX i found that they were not applying the late fees payments towards the late fees but to my principle balance. So my late fees started piling up. When i realized what they had done i sent them an email asking them to apply those payments to my late charges and not my principle balance. This was never done. That however is not what my complaint is about I received a call from them regarding the continued late payments and they offered me a deferment of the outstanding balance. We all agreed and two payments were deferred to the end of the loan. Now the next installment is due and the late fees are on there. I was told the balance including late fees would be deferred, so when i got my statement it had a XXXX late added to it along with the XXXX dollars in late fees i stilled owed. When i called them to point this out I first got the same story from the first rep i talked to then she put me on hold to review my account and a second rep picked up the phone and stated that late fees do not get deferred and that the XXXX   dollars i paid was for a deferment fee.

I understood that what the XXXX dollars was for and that i was instructed by there rep when I initially did this that they would be, I also told the rep that I did not have a problem paying the late fees of XXXX dollars still owed. my Problem was that they were charging me another XXXX dollar late fee for the late fees not being paid. So they were they charging me a late fee on a late fee. One not to sure if that is legal they say it is in the contract, however i do not believe you can contract away the rules or law, which i told i felt that the contract was in error and i just missed that clause if there, but i am paying for misleading information on there part and no where does it state that i need to clear the late charges, not even in the letter of verification they sent. I went ahead and payed the late fee with the new payment. But feel that this practice is not legal and defiantly not very moral all I wanted was the XXXX dollar late fee waived not to much to ask for their error I think. So know I turn to you to check out fi they can indeed charge a person a late fee on an outstanding late fee amount. Enclosed is a copy of the different letter as well as the last two months statements, of which may does not show a late fee being accesses and XX/XX/XXXX with the assessment of a late fee, very confusing."
Vehicle loan or lease,"Complaint : Posted check to closed account # XXXX and does not return check ( 3 + month past due ) Using automatic bill pay I sent two checks on XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18 to Chase Auto Finance in the amount of {$2600.00} each, this payment was sent by mistake and was not intended for Chase Auto Finance. 
Realizing my mistake I called Chase Auto finance on second week of XX/XX/XXXX and I was assured that checks will not be cashed and will be sent back within 10 business day since my auto loan ( loan # XXXX ) at Chase Auto Finance was closed several years back. While I was following up on weekly basis Chase deposits check on XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18. So either the customer service representative was lying to me or the account department was lying to customer representative that they are reversing the posting and sending back the check. 
As of today XX/XX/2018 it's been more than 3 months, several follow up, fax message and faxing bank statement proof has not yielded any result. Every phone call they keep assuring that there is work order ( case # XXXX ( not sure if this is valid or a made up number by customer rep. ) ) and I will receive my check in 10 business day but Chase is not returning my check. How can chase post a check to closed account and hold it as their revenue isn't it against the accounting rule?"
Student loan,"XXXX XXXX XXXX took over XXXX XXXX Loans in XX/XX/2017. Since then I have been unable to access my account. I have received no correspondence since the take over regarding my account. For over a year I have tried to log-in to my account with no success. I have also tried calling customer service. Each time I receive a message or am told that the action is unavailable and to try again later, or that my account can not be found ( See attached images ). Because of this I am unable to check my account or pay my bill. It seems like many other people are having this problem as well. I can only imagine the mess this is causing, as I have been unable to pay my student loan in over a year and have received no billing information. Something is clearly wrong here."
Mortgage,"My complaint is how an insurance claim is not being handled in a professional or perhaps ethical way. I filed a claim in XXXX for a broken pipe, the insurance company sent a 3rd party adjuster and a check made out to me and Freedom Mortgage for {$10000.00} ( copy of check attached ) the ins comp said to mail the check to Freedom who will endorse the check and return to me. I followed up with Freedom who said they would not release the check to me, until I sent them several documents. 1 ) Adjuster Claim, 2 ) Contractor signed estimate signed by me and contractor 3 ) signed contractor paid receipt for Monies already paid to the tune of {$6000.00}, 4 ) Signed Lien or mechanics lien 5 ) XXXX  for contractor 6 ) letter requesting reimbursement of funds 7 ) copy of contractors License. After several days of follow-up they claimed they didn't receive the documents I sent them all again in one shot. I have attached all the documents listed above to this complaint so you can review also. They also said they would only send me 25 % of the {$10000.00}. The insurance company were insisting I do work on the house before anymore damage was done, I couldn't wait for Freedom to send the check, so I used my mortgage money payment to pay the contractor to do some of the initial clean up and preparation, and as a deposit. ( attached receipt ) I told them, if they are concerned, because now I am in default, they can keep {$5300.00} and send me the difference, that would cover 2 months mortgage payments, they refused ( all documented attached ) I need help getting my money, I am falling behind on my mortgage payments and I think they are doing this on purpose to force me into foreclosure.

Mortgage,"OCWEN now charges to collect mortgage payments A few months ago, OCWEN changed how they collect mortgage payments. Now, on their web site, you must sign up for their auto bill pay system, or you are forced to use a third party bill pay system - XXXX XXXX ( which charges {$7.00} ) in order to complete the process of paying your mortgage. 

I have never experienced a mortgage lien holder or a bank ever charge a customer for payment. Aside from inconvenience, I'd like to know if this is legal. This is not the contractual repayment plan we made, and me simply raising this with them - I have no voice and no power to affect change. I just get transferred around and put on hold for long periods of time with no one able to help me and no one empowered to be my voice within the company. 

Lastly, I would like someone from CFPB to weigh in on if this practice is considered legal.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I filed complaint XXXX with CFPB and XXXX  Case # XXXX about the inaccurate derogatory information on my credit file. My credit file still shows charges and invalid payment dates that contradict my credit file. The balance and amount are not correct and the charges are inaccurate. About a month ago I filed a ftc identify theft report because some of the charges on this account, I have no knowledge of. The company could not tell me where these charges came from. I attempted to reach out to the company to get this corrected, but it still remains on my credit file. I am not sure how the additional charges got on my account, I also created a police report in order to dispute this information on my credit file. By law if there are fraudulent charges the company reporting the fraudulent charges have to remove this information due to my sworn affidavit and police report. But this company is still reporting this inaccurate information on my credit file. I am appalled that I had to go this far to clear my name when I have contacted this company numerous times. My credit file is all I have to represent my creditworthiness. This invalid information is damaging my creditworthiness and is against the law. After multiple avenues to get this fixed this is my last option without taking legal action. 

Once again, please remove this invalid derogatory information from my credit file, per FTC affidavit and attached police report to avoid further escalation of this issue and breach of FCRA and FTC regulations."

3. The XXXX account person refused to remove the debt, despite proof that the debt was not mine, without a POLICE REPORT. The local police are not going to waste their time with a police report for a debt in Arizona for {$250.00}. This was meant to be a barrier to me and make me pay the money."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I am submitting this claim because I had a Citibank AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard and on the anniversary of my credit card account, Citibank very unethically charged me the {$450.00} annual fee and then closed my account a few days later without notice and without an explanation. 

The Annual Fee includes a host of benefits, including a 1 year membership into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, having been charged the fee, I expect to receive the benefit. 

Counter to any intuition, Citibank canceled my card, canceled the XXXX 's XXXX membership, and refuses to refund the {$450.00}. Therefore, Citibank has been unjustly enriched since I was forced to pay for a benefit I never received. 

I called Citibank Customer Service and they wouldn't help me. So I wrote a letter to the Citibank Executive Response team and they ignored my request to refund the {$450.00}. 

This has prompted me to file this complaint."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In mid XX/XX/XXXX I reported my Synchrony Car Care card lost. Upon doing that I was told that I would be sent a new card. Weeks went by ... no card. So I logged in on XX/XX/XXXX and scheduled my monthly payment for XX/XX/XXXX ( due date ). 
XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received a card and my account was no longer accessible online. I called rep and she said a new card had just been issued and made it so that I was able to set up the new account online. XX/XX/XXXX my payment had not posted to my account, so I contacted Synchrony via their message portal to have record of our conversation. I asked them where my payment was and gave them confirmation #. They replied that it takes 2 business days to process & post. I gave them 5 days before I contacted again. Payment had not posted nor had it been deducted from bank account. I asked them to credit my account for the payment and deal with finding the actual payment later since we were both in agreement that the payment had been made via the confirmation #. 
They contacted me 2 days later and said "" As per your request, our records indicate that an online payment of {$27.00} was cancelled on your account for XX/XX/2018. '' I informed them that I NEVER asked them to cancel a payment ... I asked them to credit my payment and they have the messages there to prove I NEVER requested that. They in turn contacted me 3 days after ( XX/XX/XXXX )  I messaged them this and stated that they had confirmation # for cancellation and they would reverse the late payment fee. 
Since I found out that day that they cancelled my payment, I made them aware that I was making my payment the same day. 
After I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX again, I logged in to new account to make payment, once logged in I noticed that they doubled my payment due to {$46.00} because of the late fee. Once I contacted them about this they said "" Our records indicate that the payment of {$27.00} was not paid by XX/XX/2018. Please note that the minimum payment due will increase on your account when there is a late payment. The minimum payment due is around 3.5 % of the balance, plus the late fee, plus the interest charge, plus the past due amount. '' The payment was late because THEY cancelled it!! I asked them to reduce minimum due to what it should be but now they won't reduce it to the correct amount. They keep saying I made my payment late! 
I have been back and forth with them up until today. I even spoke to a manage who kept telling me that I logged in and cancelled the payment myself after I kept telling her I didn't. Why would I cancel payment if I didn't have access to old account to log in and cancel ... .and additionally why would I cancel payment if I'm asking you to credit the payment and find it since it already has a confirmation #. It didn't make sense what she was telling me. In customer service pattern after I asked her to stop over talking me and actually listen, she hung up on me. I called back and the new rep said there was no other manager to speak to, there was no one over the manager that hung up on me to speak to and she couldn't do anything because the manager that had hung up on me noted my account ( it's XXXX ... how is she already gone for the day? That was a lie ) that no one could make any adjustments and left for the day. 
I have proof that I did not request my payment to be cancelled. I have proof that Synchrony did that on their own because they sent me email notification that they cancelled it because my account had a balance of 'XXXX '. Which led me to believe that when they opened my new account, my payment was there but instead of letting it sit and wait for the balance from the old account to be transferred over, they cancelled my payment and now are placing blame on me and penalizing me. My minimum due should be $ XXXX- {$27.00}. I have currently been out of work and trying to make my payments on time. The minimum due is what I budgeted for but yet the doubled my payment on me through no fault of mines but are placing fault on me and won't reduce it or adjust it.Saying because statement has already been generated they can't do anything. I've gotten so many different excuses as to why they can't fix their mistake that its crazy. 
If I make a mistake or am late, I will be the first to admit, but in this case it was NOT me!!"

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I borrowed {$300.00} from mypaydayloan.com. I was paying {$90.00} every other week to "" extend '' the loan. I did this for 14 payments which equaled {$1400.00}, but still "" owed '' them {$390.00}. This {$90.00} was only to extend the loan and was not being used to pay down any of the principal.

I am now being contacted by XXXX at work, at relatives saying I owe them {$1000.00} ... how in the heck can I still owe them that much. Oh ... .penalties and interest of course!! How absurd ... what a sham and a scam! I would hate to see other people who are in need of quick funds get pulled into this wicked operation!!"
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","In the second week of XX/XX/2018 I applied for a personal loan from Citibank for {$12000.00}. 

I have had an account with Citibank for more than five years, and have had two loans with them, one paid off in full, the second with less than 1/3 of  the balance left on it. 

Perhaps the most foolish thing I did was listen to the advice of the XXXX personal banker at the bank. He gave terrible, misleading advice throughout, and it's obvious at this point that his chief priority was to get his share of whatever bonus is offered from him making new loans. 

The loan came back as approved for {$10000.00}, and he started celebrating the loan approval. But after a few seconds of celebrating, he realized that he had not pressed the right key, and the loan was assigned to an underwriter. He was surprised, and said it was a formality that occasionally took place to make underwriters useful in their work role, and that it would take a few more days, but then at that time the loan would be approved. 

A letter was mailed out to me telling me of my approval, saying that some additional documents were required within 15 days. The documents were tax returns from the last few years, all which confirmed income that far exceeds the nominal scope and amount of the loan. The pathetic personal banker failed to mention this information before I left the branch, and I told him I was going out of town for ten days. By the time I returned and sent in the tax forms that had been requested, the application had been put on the fast track for rejection, and it was obvious when I called in to check on its status, and a total pathetic XXXX answered the inquiry, that this XXXX bank had any intention of honoring the loan approval. 

In conclusion, Citibank is a pile of garbage that hires really XXXX people to work for it. I'm sure this has to do with other factors such as the particular demo and traits of who gets approved for loans, and it is something I will keep in mind as I wind down my dealings with this fast-failing institution for losers."
Vehicle loan or lease,I called American Honda Finance on XX/XX/2017 tonask for a special payment plan because Inwas in between jobs and I needed assistance. The representative stated that I qualified for a special payment plan since I had a great payment history for the past 2 in a half years prior. They asked me if I wanted to initiate this special payment plan and I agreed and said yes. This special payment plan allowed me to bypass two months of payments. They then mentioned they would temporarily remove me off of easy pay and to call back a month later in XXXX if I wanted to get back on easy pay. Only if I had the means to make a payment. I received no calls or no notifications that my payments were late because To me they representative stated I would be on the special plan. I then call back in XXXX to make sure everything was well and was going okay and they informed me I was behind on my payments! I asked why if I was on a special payment plan and they stated that I never initiated the payment plan! I stated that I did because I really needed it and they denied it so now my credit score went down 54 points!! They dropped the ball because they told me to call back if I wanted to get my on easy pay and they stated that they told me to call back to initiate payment plan which is false because I needed the special payment plan to go into affect immediately starting when I called!

I'm unable to see a copy of this check online or get a copy from the bank. This is yet another example of Wells Fargo Bank continuing to act unethically and still from us.

Student loan,"I have a POA ( Power Of Attorney ) to act on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX, the father whose daughter, XXXX XXXX, was a student who passed away in 2015. The father was the co-signer and has continued making payments since his daughter 's death. 

Since last year, I have been in continued contact with AES ( American Education Services ), the current student loan processor, seeking loan forgiveness. 

Except for this loan, all of the student 's other private student loans were forgiven due to death. 

In XXXX of last year, I'd located and contacted the original lender ( XXXX XXXX  ). I was told that XXXX  's policy is to forgive student loans when the student borrower passes away. Unfortunately, XXXX had sold the loan and had no record of whom it had been sold to. XXXX had no record of when the loan was sold ( ie. before or after the date of the student 's death ). XXXX told me that they had changed computer systems and loan processors and dated records no longer exist. I was directed to their current loan processor, AES, with whom I had already initiated contact. 

It took most of last year, to locate the loan with AES, to get them to agree that the loan should be forgiven, and to get them to request loan forgiveness. It also took most of the year before AES would divulge to me that XXXX owns the loan. Since last year, I have made THREE formal requests via AES to have the loan forgiven due to death. Each time, AES has sent a letter to XXXX making a formal request for loan forgiveness. XXXX has not responded to any of the requests that AES has made. 

The student was the father 's only child ; thus, the loss was and continues to be extremely traumatic. Every time that he made a payment, he relived the loss of his only child and grieves. I've explained this to AES countless times. In fact, the grief was so great that the father, against my advice, PREPAID a significant portion of the loan just to avoid the pain at payment time. 

Based on research that I've done, I believe that XXXX  has lost all records ( ownership paperwork ) for this student loan. XXXX 's failure to maintain or locate the loan record should NOT prevent them from forgiving the loan. 

I've attached a copy of an AES letter to me. This letter contains copies of AES letters sent to the father confirming the last two formal requests that I'd made to AES for loan forgiveness from XXXX. These documents have all of the relevant information needed to identify the loan."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Although I no longer have access to this account, However, the customer service staff at Care Credit gave me the following information.

This XX/XX/XXXX- I noticed on my credit report we received from our mortgage company ( much more in-depth ) that there was another charge on the same CareCredit for XXXX. 

I did not make this charge and would like to know where the money was sent. It did not go to my XXXX  's office. I only made this one purchase on this card. The irony is it was paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. 

If you call fraud at CareCredit they say they only have statements 6 months back. If you call customer service who does have access to XX/XX/XXXXthey say you have to call Fraud. Therefore, no one can tell me where the money went. It appears my card was used as a cash advance that I can not understand. And I believe it was my husband XXXX XXXX who did this. I tried to access my CareCredit account online and there was a username saved on the login site that was not mine. It was XXXX. That looks like a social security number. There was no saved PW so I could not log in. Therefore, it would be my IP address which is scary. I would like to know who or what banks made the payments for this second {$4200.00} fraudulent charge ( 1st criminal to pay it back ) and what bank or business received the money?

I fell behind a couple of months due to the loss of business. My loan was only 60-70 days past due and Chase decided to repossess my vehicle. Immediately after the repossession I called Chase to inform them my financial situation had normalized and I was ready to pay the entire past due balance in full to get access to my vehicle. I also explained there was a temporary loss of business but that it had all been resolved and recovered. I was back in a financial position to resume with my loan. Chase denied me any options to renegotiate or pay the balance past due despite me having ALL the money ready so I could regain access to my vehicle. They said the vehicle would go to auction and I would be responsible for the difference. I explained to them that I rely on this vehicle for work purposes and I was back in a financial position to continue with the loan. They said the decision to sell the vehicle had been made final and there was nothing they could do. I added that I had a previous relationship with Chase on another vehicle I financed through them which I paid on time for over 2 years. They refused to acknowledge that positive history with them.
Mortgage,"We had an insurance claim on our primary home, nationstar mortgage now known as Mr. Cooper has been managing our claim funds of over {$100000.00} for over two years now. They have been extremely difficult and at many times delayed the disbursement of funds which has also delayed the reconstructions of our home. This company caused us incur extra expenses which they have not reimbursed us for yet. This is our second time complaining about this company to your office. Our main issue now is the remaining of the escrow funds left from our insurance claim has been sitting in their "" escrow/loss draft '' department for months, after our several attempts in getting Mr. Cooper to apply those remaining funds into the principal of our mortgage loan. We have called multiple times and have spoke to their loss draft department which are in charge of our insurance claim funds and we explained the reconstruction of our home has been completed for quite a while and we specifically asked them to please apply the left over funds of over {$8000.00} into the principal balance of the mortgage loan. At one point we were told this would be completed within 5 days. We called six week later as this was still not completed, we spoke to the same gentleman XXXX in loss draft department and he gave us unreasonable excuses as to why this was not done. He promised to call us back in a week and as of today it has been over 4 weeks since our last conversation with him. We ask that Mr. Cooper provide us with a detail report of all the funds to our insurance claim and to apply all left over funds into the principal balance of our mortgage as previously requested. We are extremely upset with this servicing company on how they have handled our claim funds. Even after two years since our claim, they continue to delay disbursement of our funds even when we simply ask to apply them towards our principal balance. My husband and I want your office to review in detail how these funds have been handled as we are afraid they have mismanaged our funds. This servicing company should not be allowed to handle insurance claim funds."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2017. Hurricane Irma came through Georgia and devastated my home and life. I immediately seeked assistance from my mortgage company as advised by my homeowners insurance, family and friends. They said, "" We are here to help you '' and we have a "" Disaster Assistance Program '' that will assist with deferring payment up to 90 days. After the 90 day period, I would have options ... Option # 1 Pay all back mortgage in full, Option # 2, Set up a payment plan to pay a little more every month until all back mortgage payments have been caught up, Option # 3, Do a Disaster modification reset, where they will basically work the back payments back into my entire loan and reset my mortgage payments to the current interest rate. In XXXX, I called to go over options again and decided to do a Disaster Modification. Before the deadline I also called to verify that everything was still on delay and that this would not affect my credit score. The reasons for these follow-up calls was for me to get clarification and confirmation, because I am a single mother - first time homeowner and I have worked tirelessly to rectify my credit and to keep a perfect credit standing with my mortgage company. I waited for the Modification documents to be sent to me for over a month and when I finally received them I immediately ( within a day ) sent them back via email. I all the while was receiving harassing calls from the collections department, threatening to Foreclose on my home. I also want to mention that I called several times within that month to check the status of modification documents being sent. It seemed as if one hand didn't know what the other hand was doing at M & T Bank. I guess I couldn't expect good communication to me, when they didn't even communicate within their own organization. Once I finally received the documents and sent them back for their review and Underwriting 's approval, that took a while too ( almost another month ). Now, I'm into XXXX and this is when I was told about something like a "" Moratorium ''???? They said that it ended and I was not approved for the Disaster Modification, because my part of Georgia wasn't declared affected ... Now What? I was clearly upset and baffled, what do I do now? They told me my options, once again ... Option # 1 you can pay the back payments or Option # 2 apply for a regular Modification and they will send out new paperwork for this type of modification. I then asked to please explain the difference between these modifications ( they seemed to be the same ) Why didn't they send these documents the first time? They said that it just came out that my region of Georgia didn't get declared affected. At this point I did the same once again and returned the requested documents and forms back via email within a day. It took once again 2-3 weeks for me to get an answer. I called weekly just as before and no one could tell me anything, except that it was in underwriting. One day 3 weeks  later I received a package in the mail that stated I was approved and explained my new payments indefinitely. Unbeknownst to me, It also said that in the meantime my credit will now reflect negatively for the past due payments of three months. Meanwhile, during this whole fiasco I made double payments ( 2 ) times and I am only now a month in the rear. I have been clearly taken advantage of ... I kept calling specifying that I do not want my credit to be affected and will M & T report this negatively on my credit. They kept reassuring me that they are not reporting to the credit bureaus and now ALL at once there are 3 months of damaging entries on my credit and my score went down by 300 points. This is unacceptable and this whole experience has truly been a real DISASTER ... Before their proposition, my payments were never late and my credit was great. Everything is reflected in the notes on my M & T account. Now, I am back at square one with my credit being ruined and I feel misguided and taken advantage of by my Mortgage Company."
Credit card or prepaid card,I was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found late payments on the dates below : 30   days late as of XX/XX/2018 and 60 days late as of XX/XX/2018 ( all 3 bureaus ) I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments to you when I received my statement. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.
Debt collection,"XX/XX/2018 - 5 accounts through XXXX XXXX open. 4 at 6.8 %, 1 at 3.4 %. Refinanced at 4.49 % through XXXX serviced. 

XX/XX/2018 : checks for each account to close were instead bundled and fairshared. Now have 5 accounts with XXXX ( for smaller amount ) and 1 with XXXX XXXX. Making weekly payments XX/XX/2018 : caught error and called. Spoke with all 3 institutions to correct error check-by-check in conference call. Was told it would take 2 weeks XX/XX/2018 : nothing changed. Went ahead and paid off 1 loan ( {$300.00} ). By the following Monday, I had credits in 3 accounts at 6.8, a higher balancein 3.4, and over XXXX in one 6.8. Should have been under {$3000.00} total. Have spoken 11 times with the organization since and it is still incorrect. 

XX/XX/2018 : had spoken with an individual that they are issuing a credit to common bond and I would receive a credit for XXXX to the 3.4 account, making the balance XXXX. This was correct. Now have 4 accouns open again with credits and 1 account at XXXX. 

I have repeatedly tried to escalate throughout this process. I spoke with a tier 3 who has an extension. He has yet to return a call. Another escalation escalated to their supervisor who would not come to the phone and provided a 2 day business day turnaround. I received no call. My credit has since dropped 4 points."
Checking or savings account,"This complaint is for Barclay 's US bank ( Barclays Bank Delaware in XXXX DE ). I have multiple complaints about this back including : 1 ) Gross misrepresentation of the US Patriot Act in an apparent effort to illegally freeze accounts and or account access of US citizens.

2 ) Breach of contract for it's certificate of deposit holders 3 ) Failure to provide the legal documentation for accounts ( deposit certificate, statements, forms to close account, etc ) to US account holders, even after being told to do so over a dozen times.

4 ) Theft of the funds held in my account from me. 


I have contacted the bank over a dozen times over the past month and several other times in the past ( Supervisors XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, et al have been involved in some of these requests ). They have been informed that they are in breach of contract by freezing my account and/or access to my account which I opened 3 years ago. I have told them numerous times that I never received any information in the mail at my legal address about my account, that they never even sent me an account number for my account, and that I find them in breach of contract. 

This bank is horrible and they are risking financial misery of all their US clients by grossly misrepresenting the US Patriot Act. They have stated to me that they can freeze accounts purely because a customer does not wish to risk his/her identity security by giving out confidential information over the phone each and every year to avoid freezing their accounts, and they are doing this only to have the customer prove that he/she is the same person and has not moved since last year. I know of no other bank in the USA that acts in such an extreme and radical manner. They have no basis or evidence to suggest any of my information has changed ( I still have the same name and reside at the same home, which I also own and the public records proves that ) and yet they are freezing accounts and refusing to send the account documentation to the account holder 's legal address - and even after they have been informed that said account holder wishes to close their account immediately and requires the necessary forms to do so. 

I have had this account for 3 years and even though I have complained many, many times they have not sent me one acknowledgement of the account with an account number or one statement.

I hereby request that the US Gov't investigate the practices of this bank. Every bank that operates in the United States mails a certificate of deposit statement, account statement, etc to the mailing address on record for the account yet this bank refuses to do so."
Debt collection,"I called back in XXXX to settle this account after they switched to a new collection agency for a XXXX  XXXX  account. We agreed to 3 payments of XXXX appx. They took the first payment in XXXX, all events are for year 2018,. After the first payment I called back within that same first week and asked to cancel the arrangement because I could not afford it any longer and I was moving soon. The representative was very rude and threatened to report the account back to the credit bureau under the previous full balance versus what I even just paid. She told me she would cancel the arrangement and when I asked to speak to her supervisory regarding her service she refused and told me no supervisors were available when I called back I was placed on a block list. I called back today XXXX to find out why they charged my account again I spoke with a very rude supervisory who began to raise her voice to me and yell. I asked to speak with her manager because I wanted the previous call reviewed in XXXX she told me she would not do that nor did she have available and begin to get really rude saying I could call back and speak to a supervisory who was her equivalent. Once again when I tried to call back to customer service my number was blocked and I did record it this time. They charged my account when I asked to cancel the arrangement and refused to resolve the bill error they caused and threatened to report the full amount less the one payment I made."
Mortgage,"The intent of this complaint is to force the apathetic Specialized Loan Services ( SLS ) to do the right thing and correct the errors they acknowledged making. 

Our relationship with SLS began XX/XX/XXXX when we refinanced our home. As is typical refinance protocol, we provided all required documents -- including proof of dwelling and homeowners insurance -- to finalize the agreement. Since XX/XX/XXXX, we have received daily harassing calls from Specialized Loan Services ' ( SLS ) Collection Department due to an unwarranted impound account created because of internal clerical errors surrounding alleged lack of dwelling and homeowners insurance. As a result of the impound account, our monthly mortgage was increased to cover the cost of said insurance. Because we had recently provided proof of insurance at the close of refinance and because we knew this was an error, we continued to pay our mortgage as agreed sans the increased impound amount. 

As proven through various communications starting from the first notice and including most recently, through the XXXX XXXX XXXX, we have always maintained insurance. That said, in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) SLS finally acknowledged their error stating their intent to immediately correct the errors and reverse the negative marks to credit reporting agencies. Thirty days later, I still receive harassing calls and our credit has not been fixed. As recently as Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, SLS confirmed they would look into the lack of progress and then on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, they confirmed they could not find the letters and another investigation would be opened. 

Please know, SLS ' disinterested response and lack of action has caused much distress and become a huge financial burden to my family because of high interest rates and loan denials over the past two years. We have always worked diligently to pay our debt as agreed to however much of the payments go to pay interest as opposed to principal. 
We can not continue this vicious circle of high interest rate. 

Our goal with the letter is to once and for all force SLS to fix the errors internally and with the Credit Reporting Agencies."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I was searching for potential apartments to move into on XXXX when I came across a 1-bedroom apartment ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ) for $ XXXX/month. During the afternoon of XX/XX/2018, I messaged the property manager, XXXX XXXX, through XXXX. At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, he sent me an email with more information about the apartment. I asked if I could view the apartment before filling out an application, but he said I could not view the apartment until the current tenant moved out on XX/XX/XXXX. He said for now I could secure the apartment by signing a Lease Agreement and wiring the first month rent ( {$2300.00} ) and security deposit ( {$1500.00} ) to  the Landlord ( XXXX XXXX ). XXXX said when I do view the apartment and decide I do not want it, I will be fully refunded. I emailed him the completed Lease Agreement on XX/XX/XXXX,  and the wired money went through to the Landlord 's BB & T  account on XX/XX/XXXX. He agreed to show me the apartment on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. However, on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, he emailed me saying he could not show me the apartment because his mother just XXXX XXXX with XXXX, and he won't be back until XX/XX/XXXX. Since I currently live in this apartment complex but in a different unit, I decided to go to XXXX XXXX XXXX to see if anyone lives there. At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I knocked on the door of the apartment, and the couple living there answered. They said they are the residents of the apartment and are not planning to move out any time soon. At around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the XXXX XXXX Police Department to report this fraudulent incident."
Debt collection,XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed that I would pay a {$1900.00} by XX/XX/2019. In return they would not contact my new employer. I told them who I worked for and paid the total amount by the due date. They still contacted my employer before the due date.
Student loan,"I started my consolation in XX/XX/XXXX, My school loans total XXXX but the payment was XXXX per month so when with XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX, XXXX to reduce my month payments. I had a full time job but I work for a XXXX  company and had to pay child support. My budget was fixed. Few years into my plan with them they offered to me a discount for non-payment.

So for many years until present time they had a system that pushes me off my plan after a year or so. In the beginning year I would be reminded and helped with the paperwork. Later year, they were NO help. There answer was always to put me on forbearance for six months. Which put more money on my loan and interest too. It was a scam so I could never pay this loan off. In XX/XX/XXXX, I had taken school loan out and pay them off before ten year because it wasn't a scam.

More then that I when qualified for program for working for a XXXX the more difficult they became. I sent them a copy of my income taxes but they didn't due anything to fix my problem. I got paperwork back into them and they did nothing to help fix my payment problem. For over a year they locked me out of web system but wouldn't help unlock to get my loan straighten out. Nobody would help by phone and they would push me back to a locked system. My loan when from XXXX to XXXX because they locked me out of the system. These last two year I steadily pay them XXXX a month because they would help fix my payment plan. They locked me out of payment plan all together and try to false report that I wasn't paying them XXXX a month. They reported on my credit report that I didn't make any payment but I pay XXXX a month.

This company even advertises on the radio and I called them for help from the commercial. They refused to help me telling me that I need to send in my income tax again. I did but no help. There answer always to put the loan on forbearance, which jack the amount of the loan up.

This company uses unfair credit practices. If I had a normal bill month that I could pay then I would. I've had this loan payment for more then 15 years but it only went up even though I paid almost every month."
Checking or savings account,"I became aware that my internet service provider, XXXX, had made 3 unauthorized debits to my checking account. The last charge being very large, {$510.00}, taken out on XX/XX/2018 and today 's date is XX/XX/2018. I tried calling XXXX but they argued with me saying that I had approved it for them to make auto pay payments for my internet service. I told them that I had not and it all ended badly with my hanging up. I then went to my bank ( Wells Fargo ) to let them know of the charges. What it all boiled down to and what they told me was that because I still had an account open with XXXX they could not dispute the charges and could do nothing for me. I don't understand this because if I did not authorize them to start taking payments from my account then it is not their account to be going into. Not their money to take!"
Debt collection,"Keep getting repeated robo calls from company called ERC. I do not owe any debt, have been debt free for last 15 years, except for 2 auto loans which are paid via allotment. I have even went so far as to go to the ERC web site and filled out form to have them stop calling me but the calls still persist. I am XXXX and wife is XXXX and these repeated calls upset us. I am asking that this company be charge a fine or whatever the legal term is of {$500.00} for each phone call. My FICO score is XXXX and no bad credit in my credit report for last 25 years or longer!"
Checking or savings account,I have spoken with three representatives at chase bank about my concerns and all of them are on a different page. There is no exact answer as to why my account is negative and I disagree with being charged twice no representation being shown for It.
Student loan,"I have parent plus student loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX in Iowa, start paying XX/XX/2008 and ( my monthly payment was XXXX $ ) my paper statement amount of principal and customer service amount are different. Paper statements show original principal amount of loan is XXXX and I paid XXXX ( plus interest of XXXX ) but when I contact customer service they told me I have principal amount of XXXX. That is different amount of XXXX. I spoke with customer service many times to explain me what is wrong or right and they are rude and unprofessional, unfortunately they didnt tell me why paper statements balance and balance in sistem not same. Something is wrong and I find out that many people complain about same problem with this company."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","A unauthorized company, XXXX XXXX debited my PayPal account {$4.00} and {$83.00}. I noticed it right away and notified paypal. Pay pal refuses unauthorized transaction refund because they suggest the purchase is consistent with others in the account. I don't even know what this company "" XXXX XXXX '' is all about."
Debt collection,"Waypoint Resource Group called XXXX, and attempted to contact a person, who prior to 2012, had this phone number. Since XX/XX/2012, this number has been assigned to XXXX XXXX, who does not know nor is related to XXXX XXXX, the individual Waypoint tried to contact. 

Waypoint Resource Group needs to exercise more due diligence with respect to calling people with whom they have no business or reason to call. Whether or not this call was intentional or due to an error, it still translates into an invasion of my privacy. 

Please ensure that my phone is removed from their database and that I do not receive any more phone calls. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ"
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/18, I received a charge to my Citizen 's bank checking account for {$220.00} from XXXX that I did not authorize. On XX/XX/18, I reported this unauthorized charge to Citizen 's bank, and they opened an investigation. I was told that I would receive a response within 10 business days. 

I have not received a response nor a provisional credit. I called Citizen 's bank on XX/XX/18, and was told that I should receive a provisional credit while they continue their investigation. However, I called the claims department at Citizen 's bank today ( XX/XX/18 ), and was told that I was mailed a letter on XX/XX/18. I never received such letter. The claims representative told me that they needed additional information in order to proceed, including why the charge was unauthorized and the exact date that I spoke with the vendor. I informed the agent that the charge was not supposed to occur, and that I informed the Citizen 's bank representative of this on XX/XX/18. I also told the representative that I spoke with XXXX many times when the charge occurred, and XXXX told me that they never charged my card. I asked when I would receive a provisional credit, as I understood they were required to provide it after 10 days while they continue their investigation. I was told that they would not provide a provisional credit, and that Citizen 's bank had 90 days to complete the investigation."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I recently got off the phone with my previous employer, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, on XX/XX/XXXX in attempts of starting my rollover process only to find out that they closed my account. I spoke to XXXX, the current holder of my 401k, prior to this conversation to begin the process and had everything done and finished with them. The representative was so kind to even guide me through their website, helping me make any adjustments necessary to match my needs and start my rollover. I only needed to speak to Wells Fago. 

So I spoke to Wells Fargo. Again. 

I actually spoke to a representative on XX/XX/XXXX to begin the process, but the representative wasn't very willing to help me out. Only a few minutes was spent on the call as I explained to the representative that I was unable to log into my retirement account. I've tried logging in multiple times but each time it would spring up as an unknown error and to call the representative. When I called, the representative told me to simply go onto the main webpage and enroll there since I didn't officially have any Wells Fargo accounts. I only had a team member account, one that I quickly realized that I no longer have access to. 

Without further help on the matter or any attempt to help start my rollover right then and there, she disconnected and I went online to register. I ended up being unable to register due to some technical error in the system, I ended up doing the same thing that I'd attempted to do earlier, and even now the issue remains unresolved. 

I decided to try again and give Wells Fargo a call again today, XX/XX/XXXX. After being transfered from representative to representative, I was able to talk to someone who was able to pull up my account, although it wasn't very much of a conversation. She told me that I was issued a check just a few days earlier, XX/XX/XXXX, a week after my attempt to begin my rollover with the other representative. Informing me that my previous balance was now cut by a few hundred dollars and that I will be charged penalty fees for not meeting the deadline that I was never informed of. 

I remained patient and willing to wait as she looked up my files and asked her if there was anything I could do to get the rollover started since I've spoken to the representative before and had issues logging in but the representative remained stern and gave me no further options. At the end of the conversation, she had the audacity to ask whether or not I was willing to start a retirement account with Wells Fargo and that she'd be happy to help me start one. 

Throughout the entire process I felt as though I received no help at all from Wells Fargo on the matter, I was only turned to opening new accounts with them each time. Unaware and uninformed, Wells Fargo stripped me of the money that I've been building with them as a dedicated team member."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/2018, a fraudulent activity occurred in my PayPal account, where money got sent from my account to some XXXX XXXX in the amount {$1100.00}.

I have sent two emails to XXXX XXXX ( CEO of Paypal0, but no response from him. 

I need help here, because PayPal is unwilling to rectify a fraud that occurred on their site.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/2018 I wired money to XXXX XXXX where I had lived and had a business before, and I still have a bank account with XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. The amount of money I asked to be wired was {$85000.00}. and the money which was wired to my bank was the amount of {$68000.00} EURO. At the time of the transfer I was very sick and just had a XXXX. So, I was not able to calculate the transaction amount and myself. I asked the banker who did the wire transfer for me "" how much is the rate? "" the lady sad "" I do not know and it is my fist time doing this. '' When I came back home from XXXX and visiting my family and got better and i was thinking more clearly, I calculated the amount and shocked to see how the bank has cheated me and the rate that I was charged was not a correct one. So, I went to the bank and asked a banker to put a complaint and inquiry about the wire. She did filed a complain and in a few days I got a call from the bank saying the rate is correct and if, I need further clarification to see the paper work I have to bring a sphene from the court. 

I called and wanted to talk to the CEO or someone who could help me with this matter, no one was coperating with me and I was told repeatedly to bring a sphene. I wroter to the board of directors a couple a of times and they all were unresponsive and uncooperative, and was redirected me to the same secretary. 

Attached please find copies of my correspond with the board of directors and my letters. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Debt collection,"Third District Court has issued a Pretrial court date on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX which I will provide the Judge XXXX the first police report of my home being broken into by criminals after I was threaten to not to go to the police and the second police report in regards of my XXXX  accounts being taken over and fraudulent checks deposited and then used by criminal without my knowledge and then asking the bank to do a FRAUD investigation in which XXXX assumed I gave out my password which is FALSE there is just too many issues surrounding this case and NAR inc lack of disclosure to the courts that I am XXXX on XXXX benefits and all my assets are judgement proof. Secondly, NAR inc has withheld information to the courts of fraud stating there was no Fraud so I submitted to the courts copies of all the FORGERY checks put in my name that were documented by their client XXXX. Additionally NAR inc previously ignored my Debt validation letter stating it was frivolous even the though the law states clearly under the FDCPA of my rights to dispute the debt and collection activities must cease regardless if they feel the letter was generic it should have been honored especially considering there was FORGERY CHECKS on file. The verbiage was legal and they willfully ignored the law and pursued collection attempts anyways. Furthermore, they have notified the courts of a false alleged attempt of serving papers when I wasn't even in the state of XXXX  after having my life threatened I left and went to XXXX for a period of time for my safety. As of now the Third District court after receiving the copies of FORGERY checks, and the fact I wasn't in XXXX  set ASIDE the judgement and issued a court date XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. Which I intend to explain to the Judge in full detail of the situation and information being withheld including the second police report which I will have in court. NAR inc needs to be investigated by the XXXX  attorney general office for its shady and bad collection practices.

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Around XXXX of XXXX I took out a {$2500.00} loan with a company online called XXXX XXXX XXXX. Their website left the impression that they were legally able to operate in the state of Hawaii and that they operated in accordance with the SCRA and MLA. All monthly payments were made. On XX/XX/XXXX I took out another loan with them for {$3000.00} at a 32.78 % interest. I combined my monthly payments for the two loans ( monthly payment : {$240.00} ) but the two accounts were still open. Fast forward to XXXX of XXXX when my last payment was made to them. I had some financial troubles as well as issues with my debit account. I do some research on lending laws and practices. I find out that the state I reside in- Hawaii- requires lenders to not only be licensed to do business in that state but also caps the interest rate at 24 %. I also find out that the MLA doesnt allow loan rollovers. I send an email to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX questioning the legality of the loan. I receive no response back but on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX I receive a missed call from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I return the call at XXXX XXXX and Im told by Mr. XXXX, my account representative, that I have a past due balance of around {$1600.00} and that my account will be charged off if I dont make a payment by the end of the month reflecting negatively on my credit. I set up a payment with him. I then begin to question him on the legality of the loan and he responds by listing the companys credentials and that any matter pertaining to the companys legality is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then ask for the Lending Agreement. He responds by saying I can either email the company my authorization to email the documents or check online in the Documents section of My account. I head to my account and none of the Lending Documents are there only the updated Privacy Act. I also see that my original loan of {$2500.00} has been closed without my knowledge and appeared to have been refinanced without my knowledge. I call Mr XXXX back to inquire about the lending documents. When I told him the only Documents that appeared was the Privacy Act, he responded with what more do you need then? He then proceeded to read of the loan details but made no attempt to send me the loan agreement. Only after calling him a fifth time did he give me the email contact so I could email the authorization but have no exact time frame of when Id receive a response. I am currently waiting for response as well as seeking legal advice."

Yet the calls continued, and I started to notice that my credit history was being affected via a delinquency on unpaid credit account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX i received the attached email from XXXX that a credit was issued. Yet I continued to receive bills from your firm that I still owe late fees on a returned item. I contacted your representatives and they stated that this matter was going to be resolved and that my credit history would be cleared up. My last conversation with your representative XXXX, XXXX was at XXXX EST on XX/XX/XXXX. To date my credit remains with negative/derogatory information from your firm. I believe that I have given your firm ample time to correct this condition."
Debt collection,"I have contacted Portfolio Recovery Associates ( PRA ) including but not limited to the following dates and reasons for complaint regarding a negative account they report to the credit bureaus : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, Re-aging an account, XX/XX/XXXX change in balance of account, XX/XX/XXXX reporting inaccuracies, XX/XX/XXXX changes to Date of 1st Delinquency, XX/XX/XXXX - Request additional information, XX/XX/XXXX request for validation of debt. They have violated FDCPA more times than I can count. Their communications state, "" debt too old to sue '' yet the dates they show as support are inconsistent. They have removed and added this account from reporting to my credit file. They have changed the amount owed several times. Each time I submit a written request, regardless of the nature of the complaint, I receive the same response- a partial copy of a statement. 

Additionally, each time I have disputed with PRA, I have also disputed this account with each of the Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRA 's ), XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Again, I receive the same response from the CRA 's that the "" account has been verified '' by PRA along with an "" account information has been updated '' statement from the CRA. Every time I dispute an inaccuracy, my FICO score takes a nose dive as PRA "" updates '' WRONG information. It is my belief, based on their behavior, that they knowingly and purposefully report false or inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. 

When I disputed inaccuracies in XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from the credit bureaus that they would no longer look into my complaints against PRA since the account has been "" verified ''. How can an account be verified yet, each time I dispute something, the details of the account reporting change? In XX/XX/XXXX I sent notice to all 3 credit bureaus that I demanded a re-investigation into PRA 's inaccurate and false reporting on my credit reports. Upon re-investigation, guess what? The same deal, account has been "" updated '' as a result of my investigation request. Each time I challenge false information, PRA "" updates '' with new false information. This time they sent me a 2 line synopsis of an account showing I have a balance of {$1000.00}. YET, the "" updated '' information sent to my credit bureau files shows an account balance of {$7800.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX and a last payment date of XX/XX/XXXX!  Another direct purposeful, false, inaccurate data provided from PRA. 

These ongoing direct and serious violations of the FDCPA have created a significant negative impact on my ability to obtain fair credit. As a result I have been burdened with adverse and costly credit terms or complete denial of credit for years."
Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX I got alert from Bank that Prestige Financial had tried to draft out {$440.00} out of my account but the amount wasn't there so it was declined. I called to speak with a customer service rep because I never gave them permission to store my card information and keep using. My mom paid her car payment using my card 1 time. They made her have me call to give them permission for use and I told them do not save my information for future use that it was only a 1 time use. The financial place refused to listen to me on XX/XX/XXXX and would not remove my card information until my mom called and told them otherwise. I stated to them that they never had my permission to even store the card information. Again, they refused. My mom called them and told them to remove my card information off that nobody have given them permission. Prestige Financial told my mom that they had removed my card. They lied!!! Today on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I get another alert saying that my account declined Prestige Financial amount of {$440.00} due to the amount not being on my card. How can I get this stop! They are trying to take my money and the vehicle loan isn't even mine. Nor am I giving them permission to do this. They have been made aware 2 times and still basically they are trying to steal."

Vehicle loan or lease,"I have a XXXX  XXXX XXXX  that was original financed @ GM Financial @ a  18%interest rate, After lowering the principle by payments I started a loan process for my XXXX  XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I realized the monthly notes were higher than the budget I've set for myself. I called and spoke with someone @ XXXX XXXX and cancelled the process, before I had completed closed,or signed a power of attorney to release the title. I thought it was cancelled as the representative assured me. I continued my negotiations with XXXX XXXX XXXX for a better rate and monthly payment, we reached an agreement, I paid GM Financial an additional XXXX on the principle balance as per XXXX XXXX XXXX   request  completed all the needed  paper work @ a local branch. I signed the agreement paid the appropriate licensure fees and power of attorney for title of the vehicle. The closing was on XX/XX/XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from GM Financial stating That the car was purchased by GM and the title as sent. I know I didn't complete paper work or authorization for the vehicle to be purchased by XXXX XXXX. I have been calling all Financial institutions, since receiving the letter.

I call GM nearly every day after being on hold from 30-60 minutes and I am getting different answers each time I call from it will be resolved in 48 hours until it could take 90 days.

I phoned XXXX Credit Reporting Agents starting XX/XX/XXXX when I received an alert from XXXX that someone applied for an credit card in my name on the above date and letting them know it wasn't me. I was talked to very rude and nasty and was told that anyone has the right to pull my credit report if they pleased to offer me credit. I then stated to the reps that I spoke to after calling 30 yes thirty different times back to back which I called from my cell phone which I can prove with the phone recorders. I told them I am a victim of fraud and they have the police report case # XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX with the XXXX Police Department and my information was exposed with XXXX  Credit Union and my email address is on Dark Web. I did not apply for an account and who ever has, it fraud and I told them I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft. I was then told by XXXX supervisor 's and reps there was nothing I could do but wait for two years for it to be removed. I replied It wasn't I who tried to get credit and it drop my credit score and that's not fair to me and it was fraud. I continue calling back trying to get help and wasn't able to. All I've received from XXXX was rudeness talk to nasty with no concern nor caring!"
Student loan,"My original student loan balances were {$38000.00} and {$34000.00} when the loans were consolidated and I began my $ XXXX  monthly payments on XX/XX/XXXX. I continued making the $ XXXX monthly payments as agreed until XX/XX/XXXX, when I filed a Chapter XXXX Plan. The loan servicer told me that I should not make any payments until the Chapter XXXX Plan was completed and discharged. That same advice was confirmed by my bankruptcy counsel. The Chapter XXXX Plan lasted 5 years, during which I repaid the majority of my unsecured debt and continued paying my mortgage and car payments outside the plan. Upon discharge of the Chapter XXXX Plan, Navient advised me that it had capitalized 5 years of unpaid interest, effectively doubling the amount of the unpaid principal balance. 

I am now XXXX years old, unemployed and receiving a {$2000.00} monthly social security benefit, supplemented by a small IRA fund. My wife is XXXX and also unemployed. Neither of us have been able to find employment in our respective fields. 

Navient is demanding payments of {$1100.00} for 120 months, which will result in a total repayment of over {$150000.00}. Navient purposely advised me to stop my payments during the Chapter XXXX Pan so that it could charge me nearly twice what I originally owed on my student loan. I have repeatedly requested a smaller repayment amount from Navient to no avail. My IRA will be depleted before my expected lifetime expires if I am forced to make the demanded repayment amount ( s )."

Mortgage,"I have owned my home for 35 years and face foreclosure auction on XX/XX/XXXX. My mortgage servicer Seterus refuses to consider my application for homeowner assistance programs even though I have had a recent change in my financial circumstances. I have a XXXX XXXX loan backed by the government and I know that there are new government programs available to help people in my situation. I was in a plan with Seterus but due to several default accounts from clients I was in a financial struggle. I called in and thought I had things worked out with them to make the next payment a couple of weeks late, but I was suddenly blindsided with a Notice of Default. Since that time all negotiations have stopped, even though I took action to dramatically increase my income so that I could save my home. However, XXXXeterus is not even bothering to consider this information and has now told me the only option is full reinstatement or they will sell my home. My mother and I bought this house in XXXX and I have put so much money into this place and I don't know what I would do. I need this matter to be investigated, because I know there are options available to fix this problem such as modification, forbearance or repayment plan that Seterus is denying access to. 

My mother and I bought this home back in XXXX. I have owned and operated my own business XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for 30 years and have made a good living. I entered this loan through XXXX in XXXX -- I had done a loan with them in the past and their agents contacted me and pitched and prodded me to refinance again to take advantage of the equity and the fact that they would not require any income documentation, and that the loan would be their fast and easy program. I did not realize that the adjustable rate would make my payment gradually increase over the years until it became difficult to afford. After the loan was transferred to Seterus I  ended up applying for and was approved for a loan modification. About a year ago I had some issues with clients who did not pay me for the services rendered. It is tough when you are a woman and a small business because some people feel they can take advantage and not pay in full for services rendered because they know you will not take them to court. This caused me to default on my modification. 

I contacted Seterus and worked out a repayment plan where I would pay {$2200.00} a month ( instead of regular payment of {$1500.00} a month ) to catch up on the delinquent payments over time. I was to make 6 of these payments. I made the first three with no problem then I ran into financial troubles again. I called in and asked if I could make the payment late, and they accepted the phone payment. I explained that I would be late again the following month because I was still not caught up and was told that would be fine. However, the following month before I could make my payment I received a Notice of Default and then Seterus refused to accept a single payment from me and began telling me that I needed to reinstate the full past due balance. I began frantically trying to get documents in for review for a new modification but have been given various excusesall documents not received, not eligible because I had a modification before, unable to lower payment because of current rate. I then provided proof of a change in financial circumstances due to adding a boarder and rental income several months ago, but their underwriters refuse to review this information. I believe the statement by Seterus that there is nothing that can be done is false. I have the means to make a reasonable payment and had been in a repayment plan. There are programs and plans that could be presented to avoid foreclosure but instead of reviewing my current and correct financial information Seterus wants to auction my home."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Opened a dispute XXXX at which Citicards provided me a conditional credit and sent the Vendor a letter seeking more information. The Vendor sent information CLEARLY states that problem still existed after he left and he was contacted at least 3 times to repair the issue, cancellation policy but citicard 's policy is to reverse the credit pending investigation. I called Citicards many times requesting to talk to an investigator, they take my contact number and tell me that someone will call me back but on one ever does. I am beginning to feel that Citicards doesn't really have an investigation department!!! So, I had to resort to this method to get my money back before I file a legal case"

I contacted the company in the beginning of XXXX and was told they would call me back the same day or the next day. I still have not heard back from the company about a new payment plan or reduction in interest.

Student loan,"Prior complaint XXXX submitted and now closed as CFPB is accepting inaccurate and false information. New York State Higher Education indicates the loan amount is {$26000.00}. However attached supporting documentation clearly shows the loan is {$21000.00}. The payment history is nothing more than a typed document, no letterhead, no official document, anyone can type something up. The term of the loan was 10 years so if you look at the so called payment statement, I still owed over {$20000.00} after paying on the loan for 9 1/2 years?"

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2018 I logged into my Bank of America app to find that three fraudulent cash withdrawals and one balance inquiry occurred on my checking account on XX/XX/2018 in Washington  DC. A total of {$4400.00} was fraudulently withdrawn from my checking account and the bank is now refusing to credit the amount stolen.

I immediately called the BOA Fraud and Claims department and reported the fraudulent activity. The representative told me there would be an investigation and that it could take up to 90 days to resolve. The bank immediately froze my checking and savings while the claim was being investigated. After my discussion with the Fraud and Claims representative, I opened a new checking account at BOA, filed reports with all 3 credit bureaus, purchased membership with XXXX and filed a police report.

Yesterday, some 70 days from my original claim, we received a letter from the Fraud & Claims indicating : AS A RESULT OF OUR RESEARCH, WE'VE DETERMINED THAT YOUR CLAIM WILL NOT BE HONORED BECAUSE YOUR DEBIT CARD AND PIN WERE USED DURING THE TRANSACTION.

We have serious concerns about the quality of the investigation that BOA conducted on our behalf and believe that the banks ultimate decision to deny my claim is unwarranted.

Over the course of the last 3 months I was able to learn that a fraudster went into 3 different branches in the Washington DC area, had a debit card and PIN and was able to withdraw large amounts of cash- {$1400.00} cash withdrawal XXXX XXXX XXXX {$1500.00} cash withdrawal XXXX XXXX   {$1400.00} cash withdrawal XXXX XXXX XXXX Balance inquiry XXXX XXXX.

What kind of investigation was really done?

Did anyone check cameras and verify who used the debit card?

How complete can an investigation be if we were never interviewed or asked for additional information?

o BOA never contacted me or my husband to ask us questions about the crime o We were never given the opportunity to complete an Affidavit Did anyone research our cash withdrawal habits?

o If they had, they would have noticed large/multiple cash withdrawals are completely inconsistent with our normal patterns of usage Did anyone determine our physical location on XX/XX/18?

o We were in the XX/XX/XXXX area on XX/XX/18 and have not been to the Wash DC area in over 5 years.

Did anyone check out our customer / employment history with the Bank?

o We have XXXX  accounts with Bank of America and have been clients for over XXXX years.

o I was a employee of XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX years I believe that Bank of America is responsible to protect its customers and the assets they hold at the Bank. What steps did the Bank take to protect me?

How did someone get out debit card?

o We did not lose our actual cards.

How did fraudster get our PIN?

Why was ID not asked for or required at 3 branches?

Arent there safeguards are in place to alert the bank or account holder of abnormal withdrawal patterns?

o One day -- -3 different banks, 3 large cash withdrawalswhy didnt any alarms go off at BANK OF AMERICA???

Throughout the investigation we have been cooperative and patient. We have taken all the steps the bank has asked of us and also taken further actions to protect ourselves from bank fraud going forward.

We believe that Bank of America failed to do a complete investigation and ultimately failed to protect us. We believe that there is no basis for our claim to be have denied and would like our {$4400.00} returned."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Opened an account with Capital One Credit Card 3 weeks ago. A day before my card arrived the card was listed as restricted. I received my card and was not able to activate it due to the restriction. On XX/XX/18, I called to enquire about the restriction and how to resolve it. They sent me a link to submit my personal documents to verify my identity. I was not able to send my SS card as the only proof of name change was my marriage license. I also sent my drivers license, passport, birth cert, XXXX license, bank statement. I called again XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They still stated the documents I sent were not adequate enough. They should have stated that from the first call. No SS card, no approval. I just sent all of my personal documents and I feel that they are fraudulent for not stating that they will ONLY accept a SS number. They have also done a hard pull on my credit. I will cancel the unusable card since they will not accept my current documentation. I want the closing of the card to not affect my credit."
Checking or savings account,"I closed my checking account on or about XX/XX/2018. My XXXX pension check was sent to the bank ( direct deposit ) and received XX/XX/XXXX. Instead of sending the check to me at my home address, the bank ( having rejected it ) sent it back to XXXX, which then sent it ( hopefully -- it hasn't arrived ) to me. 
This roundabout way of fund transfer is unacceptable. Why must I ( a XXXX citizen on a fixed income ) be forced to wait extra time for a check -- especially a fairly large one? This policy is discriminatory and must be changed. Thanks."
Debt collection,"Synchrony Bank is reporting invalid information to the three credit bureaus.

XXXX XXXX sent me documentation as well as the three Credit bureaus sent me and updated credit report, stating that they have has ceased collections on these 2 accounts and have stopped reporting to the three credit bureaus therefore these 2 accounts were  removed from my credit reports. 

How is this information being verified when Synchrony Bank stated that the accounts were sold to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX has Ceased Collections because they couldn't validate this debt as belonging to me?"

Even after submitting this information BC Services still attempted to collect on this debt after the data was provided to dispute this account as fraudulent. Address confirmation information was provided to BC Services to show she did not live at the address of the first established medical account as well as a police report indicating the issue was ID theft related. 
BC Service continued reporting of these accounts is a violation of the FCRA and FDCPA and my clients consumer rights."

Vehicle loan or lease,"When speaking to a representative within the company during the after purchase of the vehicle it was deemed we were sold a lemon vehicle. The vehicle after one month which was XX/XX/XXXX of owning the vehicle electrical system went out in the vehicle and the car locked anyone out from usage. Secondly once reaching out to the company they told us it was our own problem and that it wasn't covered under warranty, so we got that fixed once fixed the car transmission began going out as well as the engine in the car began giving problems. One time the car shut itself off during a drive and could not be started. This occurredXX/XX/XXXX and when reaching out to the company every time was told its not their problem or fault in fact that they will get their money regardless. On XX/XX/XXXX Was the final incident with the car when it would not start and the entire system locked itself out, we had been having issues over and over with the vehicle with warranties and the company just does not seem to help. The vehicle carried flood damage as well as it carried previous accident problems that was not informed and brought to us. The vehicle was still covered under warranty and still was not offered assistance and the finance company refused to help. When giving the car back not only did the company resale the car for over market value, we were not informed of the sale until a month later which it carried a balance they reported to the credit bureau that we were late. The remaining balance should not be due to the fact the company used the Gap insurance and sold the vehicle well over value, but still wants to collect when there is no need to. We will never do business with credit acceptance again."
Vehicle loan or lease,"Been making payments for a year never late! Have been over charged for insurance that they said would be correct since the first payment they asked for proof of insurance on the vehicle.

Student loan,"The following collection agencies keep repeating the same amounts in collection claims which are not valid ; thus, I am disputing all claims filed by these agencies as they have violated FCDPA Provisions which guide them on collections, statute of limitations ( Texas ), attempted to overrule Bankruptcy Court Litigation ( XX/XX/XXXX ) which resulted in liquidation of assets of which, proceeds were received by US Department of Education and violated the rights under 31 USC 3711 which is a requirement of 31 USC 3716 : *XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , OH XXXX *XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Georgia XXXX *XXXX XXXX ( for XXXX XXXX ) XXXX U.S. Department of Education Loan Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX General Correspondence : XXXX U.S. Department of Education Loan Servicing XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, PA XXXX *U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington , D.C. XXXX ____________________________________ The collection agencies ruined my credit, employment and caused unnecessary duplication in efforts of resolve issued by the student ( complainant ). 

___________________________________ On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with United States Court of Federal Claims which went to Appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, regarding tax refunds being offset as student loan debt. These types of notices had been occurring for 17 years i.e., I have not received a tax refund of which I was entitled to claim in now 18 years. 

The United States Department of Justice produced collection documentation showing that US Department of Education had collected United Student Aid Loan Amounts on XX/XX/XXXX ; yet, collections agencies continued to bill using damaged promissory and issued unlawful collections using these damaged promissory notes without my knowledge in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The records indicated the only verified amounts owed - issued by the United States Bankruptcy Court ( Trustee : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and Attorney Representation - was {$15.00}, 811.00 in relation to US Department of Education claims in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Additionally, United States Department of Justice produced records showing that I was being charged 5 % interest on a Federal Perkins Loan since XX/XX/XXXX - which was the year the Federal Perkins Loan was fully paid off. 

During the Bankruptcy filing of XX/XX/XXXX, the Trustee ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) withdrew a large number of collections claims which were not valid due to lack of paperwork ; this also included the duplicated claim amounts issued by the XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Additional records show that XXXX University and US Department of Education attempted to default me while I was attending school during years XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, and tried to charge me for XXXX college education which I carried and paid for out-of-pocket prior to my entry in to XXXX University. Indicating intentional mismanagement of my college records and causing continued interruption to my furthering educational studies beyond XXXX Level. XXXX University also withheld transcripts from potential employers in the past years even though I went personally to their administrative offices and paid for the transcripts. 

XXXX University and US Department of Education attempted to charge me under XX/XX/XXXX or later full tuition rates which is not applicable. XXXX University ( Texas ) did not have on-site / offsite housing or full service cafeteria in years XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and could have never issued anything other than tuition only costs to students attending in those years. 

Many of the collections agencies involved in the fraudulent collection practices never reported the amounts they collected in the last 18 years based on TOP reports issued by US DOJ. Additionally, much of Bureau of Fiscal Services correspondence also shows that fraudulent behavior, i.e., the representatives show to be collecting for child support services or some other state debt in the same tax year as collection for student loan debt per offset letters issued by US Department of Treasury. 

When I file as complaint regarding this situation with US Department of Education they commonly take more than 6 months to produce the information related to my education. I was employed and attended college ; thus, as a full-time student did not deserve to have my employment rights, educational rights, and financial rights degraded in last 18 years or in my senior years of my career.

When I do find a job The I.R.S. taxes me and I have to pay instead of getting a refund. Navient told me I could get a Repayment plan according my income. They told me its approved and the the next month send me a bill for {$700.00}. This goes on and on month after month and my loan went from {$36000.00} to {$42000.00}. When I try to get my I.R.S. Tax return information online I can not retrieve it .I am XXXX years old and am living on Social Security and a part time job of 15 hrs. a week .Every time you try to contact Navient you get a different individual and nothing gets accomplished.

Checking or savings account,"Morning, I opened a checking account as a new customer with Key Bank in XXXX, CT last month. Key Bank was offering {$400.00} for every new account opened with two direct deposits and payable within 60 days from the opening of an account. 

I have been working from home on a recommendation from a XXXX. I went to go deposit a check from my dad for {$180.00}. and this bank has two slots, one for cash, and one for checks which I didn't realize. Upon trying to deposit the check, I must have hit cash and could not exit out of the transaction at the ATM. I tried a {$1.00} bill, an envelope, nothing worked, so I put in a blank check from an old bank just to get the transaction finished so I could actually deposit the {$180.00}. The second time I tried depositing it, it was successful. 

Then the next day, based on an email from a friend, I signed up for a second job as a XXXX person. A bank check, appeared to be a bank check, arrived and I deposited it for {$2300.00}. After sleeping on this deposit, it seemed weird they never asked for a Ssn for tax purposes, etc. I called Key Bank and a gentlemen told me to just watch my account. That didn't sit right with me, so I reported it as a fraudulent check the next evening. I've gone to my local police, submitted any and all paperwork to KeyBank, was forced to close my account and told KeyBank will not open a new one with me! Mind you this is days before they should pay out the {$400.00}. I haven't switched banks in a long time, and have never had such a horrible experience. The guy upon opening my account at KeyBank was asking about jobs at my company, and what his friends in XXXX could do to apply as well. Now they won't open a new account-which is fine at this point-but they also mentioned absolutely nothing about the promo deposit of {$400.00}. I have never worked with such an unprofessional bank or heard of refusing to open another account. I would like someone to look into this and explain why they are refusing to accept customers and negating their promo."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","We purchased a roll up door from XXXX online. Order number XXXX. We purchased this with the expectation of a rebate that was promised. Rebate code XXXX. 

We received notice that the door was available for pickup on XX/XX/XXXX and the following week end, retrieved the item on XX/XX/2018. Now having received the merchandise, we attempted to collect the rebate. However, the rebate deal stated that it was no longer available and expired on XX/XX/2018. 

Our complaint is that we could not exercise the rebate until receipt of the merchandise, and because of their slow delivery, ( Order placed XX/XX/2018 ) we could not exercise the rebate. This was false and deceptive to offer a rebated price and then not making allowance for us to claim the rebate"
Mortgage,"PS sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated that SPS is aware of the issues presented in my RESPA letter and would like to work with me to reach a resolution.

I received a Notice of Reposting and Sale notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. to foreclose on my house on XX/XX/XXXX. I have requested an accurate payoff amount which they have not provided. There have been so many accounting issues that an SPS employee, XXXX XXXX stated during a phone call that it is impossible to validate historical amounts because the loan data came from a previous servicer. My XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement, notes that my XX/XX/XXXX unpaid payment is {$3400.00}. However, on my XX/XX/XXXX Mortgage Statement it shows my XX/XX/XXXX unpaid payment was {$2400.00}. To date they have not provided an explanation. Finally, they raised my interest rate to over 7 % and did not send a notification. Now, they are threatening to throw me, my XXXX children and XXXX dogs onto the street within days of the holidays. They need to do what they said and work with me on a resolution."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Dear CFPB, This complaint is against Equifax on their incompetence with following updating accurate personal information. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I, XXXX XXXX XXXX, after months dealing with Equifax jumping through hoops I received a letter stating they had updated my date of birth to XXXX as for some fradulant info had my DOB as XXXX XXXX. That's odd because if I that was my DOB one of the fradulant accouts that were open I would have been 4 years old. 

Here it is XXXX and now my DOB is still incorrect in their system as they didn't update my DOB and they still have the fraudalent birthday on their file. They said they don't see a case # related to my name back in XX/XX/XXXX. That's strange I have a 18 page report here on my desk from Equifax stating they updated my DOB! ( Confirmation # XXXX ) I have attached that letter from their within this complaint. 

Abosolutely Insane as they are to protect us! Outdated questions on information about my past credit cards ext ext. This should be updated by Congress the amount of questions they can ask! 

I have sent emails, been on the phone with 3 supervisors, faxed them all information. In order to now track it again I went on line and upload information on their website which they sent me another case reference # ( XXXX ) with a different fax # on the cover letter which no suprise the fax # not operating!! ( Wonderful Customer Service ) I am trying to purchase a vehicle & they have placed an extended fraud alert on my account from XX/XX/XXXX and says on their file blocked for promotional purposes. Yet I have sent all my documentations and they continue to not have the info corrected in a timely manner. 

How is it that Equifax is still in business being at their mercy. I will want to be in a class action suit against them for all my troubles with this Burea. I have all my documents from XX/XX/XXXX with Equifax and the investigation stating my information had been updated. 

Now XXXX Still having the same problem with them! This particular dealership only pulls from Equifax causing me to possibly lose the rebate to buy this car. 

Your assistitance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Vehicle loan or lease,"My husband and I bought a XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, in XX/XX/XXXX. We were financed by Santander Consumer, USA. We recently went to a car dealership ( XX/XX/XXXX ), hoping to either refinance our vehicle or be placed in another vehicle because we were making steps to clear up our credit. The manager from the car dealership ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) came out to speak to us, which I thought was strange. He stated how out of all the years selling cars, he had never seen anything like what he was seeing with our loan from Santander. Our payoff amount is {$22000.00}. We purchased the vehicle ( 3 1/2 years ago ) in which our loan was approx {$23000.00}. Unbeknownst to us the 39 payments that we made from the beginning of the loan, approx {$18000.00}, went solely to interest and only less than {$500.00} went towards the principle of the loan. We spoke with a manager from Santander, XXXX XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who told us that our contract has a simple interest rate loan, where we pay an enormous amount of interest each day our loan is late. Yes, we have been late in the past. However, within the last 12 months, we worked consistently on our payment, making sure nothing hit our credit. We were never late past the 30 days. We feel like we have been XXXX, manipulated. Yes, we might have been ignorant in going into this contract with Santander. Having a loan for almost 4 years, yes late many times, yes we put some payments towards the end of the loan, BUT $ XXXX WOW!! That's a lot of money, especially when 82 % percent of the payment goes to interest, leaving only {$160.00} going towards principle. Very upsetting and frustrating especially when we are at the verge of getting approved for a loan for our house and the only hardship is now that of this vehicle. Is there anything that can be done? Please help and/or assist us regarding this matter."
Mortgage,"Do not trust this Bank. They stole my home. First, let say I am person who had worked 60t hrs a week in my salon for over a decade. I PRIDED MY SELF ON BUILDING MY OWN HOME ON FAMILY PROPERTY AT THE YOUNG AGE OF XXXX AND BEING A SINGLE MOM. Prior to having United Bank ( XXXX XXXX ) steal my home fraudulently my credit score was never underXXXX. It now list foreclosure in the amount of {$62.00} yes only {$62.00} LOOK Down Pics..in XX/XX/XXXX I opened a line of credit with my home equity I had established since building the home in XX/XX/XXXXtotalingXXXXk to put a in ground pool in.After the construction was done I closed that line of credit, and switched it to a loan for approximately $ XXXXk ( I thought ) later was told by Mr XXXX that the banker I had  trusted and known my whole life was caught doing "" dirty loan business. "" and was forced to resign ..and he told me to go after her. ( facts are facts she did indeed not ever turn the paper work in closing the equity to a loan at the tax office. ) Rather it was Her who first kept it at a line of credit. ( I have met with her she remembers it all clear. All truth too, Down to the dollar and has told me this wasnt her. ) So me not even knowing over the next eight years paid over {$13000.00} back, all by check. ( Way over what was owed by this point ) in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I paid a total of 6 payments ahead so that way I could travel that summer with no Bill 's due. In XXXX ( just 2 mths later ) I recieved a call that my account was 9MONTHS BEHIND while I was at the beach.I  was adamant this was a simple mistake considering I seen my checks cleared. Well over the next month I could not get the bank manager XXXX to the phone. finally AFTER NO ANSWERS i went in and sat one day  from XXXX until XXXX with no one ever helping me when it was time to lock up a tellar finally told me that the bank manager was longer there.Yes that's right. Office empty and XXXX  NAME OFF DOOR. ..at that point I was referred to XXXX XXXX . over the next couple months I could not get him to explain to me where the money was that they had indeed cashed. Finally in XXXX ( the month my next payment should have been due ) Mr XXXX admitted to me there was theft in the bank not only by the original banker but that the next banker that took her spot also did SOME WRONG BY not APPLYING my payments right AND ON MY LOAN.and that I should take it up with the original one who DID THIS TO ME, ( HIS WORDS ) Well at that point it got bad because what he was saying ludicrous. It's not my fault the bank hired both his family members ( NOTICE I SAID BOTH RELATED TO HIM ) who stole my money and I was sure I could in no way loose.The last conversation XXXX and I had he told me Pay XXXXk TO GET THE ACCOUNT TO DATE OR IM FORECLOSING. my mouth wrote a check that day I couldnt cash because at that point I dared him and said you will loose. I will see you in court you a $ $ hole! He then laughed historically and said I will see you and when I take your house I'm gon na laugh in your f % $ $ $ $! face. Well guess what, He did.Because I did not get a lawyer. Not only was I not given the court date but over this period of time I lost both my mom and dad who lived in the land beside me. United bank took my first loan that I only owed XXXXk on and they sold my home for $ XXXXk..even if I did owe the whole XXXXk ( i didnt I paid back {$13000.00} back ) plus XXXXk that's a total of $ XXXXk. So they profited over XXXXk on top of all I had paid. I paid on my home 17years and they took it. Two nights after I moved out my mom passed away and I wasnt there beside her house to get there in time. So I will make sure in her name this goes public and it's never done again. If anyone else had this happen get in touch with me. I know there are more cases here exact same thing with having equity and bank takes it. Finally, I am able to get a lawyer.. look below at the credit report.

Vehicle loan or lease,"XX/XX/XXXX I bought a car XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) from ( XXXX XXXX ) a dealership in Maryland , the car was financed by CREDIT ACCEPTANCE. I asked for the price of the car but was not told. The dealer only told me my monthly payment. He said the total Im financing was {$17000.00}. With a monthly payment of {$530.00} which was scheduled for a spilt pay of XXXX every two weeks. First I was told I will not pay until after a month, which my account was debited only one week after, this took my bank account to overdraft. This was the first fraudulent action From CREDIT ACCEPTANCE. I called to question this action, this was when I was told that my balance is {$29000.00} for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I object and they said there was nothing I could do about it. That I already signed up for it. I told the associate that I never signed a single paper. Everything was done on their computer, it was late at night, I couldnt read the whole long text. I just trusted the auto giant associate who was explaining to me. Since XX/XX/XXXX Ive been making this rigorous payment and Im earlier this year I was out of job for one month which made me had a past due and I got into my car one morning and my car has been shot down. This was the first time I found out that CREDIT ACDEPTANCE had a tracker on my car without my consent. I called them and it was remotely turned on after I made a payment that morning. I missed my job and was totally messed up. This year alone my car has been turned down 4 times. My grieve right now is that I was told as at purchase that I will be eligible for refinancing as at purchase. I called them XX/XX/XXXX that I want to refinance and they said I cant that they dont do refinancing. This was absolutely different from what I was told upon signing. So Ive been paying XXXX XXXX monthly on this car without the opportunity of refinancing. They stock me up with this killing rate and with all this rigor, Ive been assulted and embarrassed by credit acceptance associate on several occasions. Theyve taken so much aggressive action on my turning down my car without notice or warning. Today XXXX of XXXX, Ive been seeing call from credit acceptance the whole day but couldnt pick up because I was at work. At the 5th time of calling me consecutively I was forced to pick up. And this lady was very rude, disrespectful and uncultured to me. Ask me to be quiet 4times in the conversation. I tried to pour out my concern to her but she never listen. She called me saying I have past due and my car will be turned down. I explained to her that I just made a payment as scheduled for me to pay on the XXXX XXXX which was a day before this day. She said a new bill has rolled over and I said Im aware but Im telling you I just made a payment yesterday. How do you call me to threaten me to turn down my car if I dont pay today when I just paid {$300.00} yesterday. All effort to convince her was abortive because she will not listen. I like to emphasis that this will not be the first time Ive been harrassed by credit acceptance associate. And I demand a review of my payment or cancelation without charge or report on my credit"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX requesting to have late payments removed from my credit report due to the fact that a retroactive deferment was granted for the student loans in question. I was told by XXXX that such reports could not be removed due to regulations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Contrary to these assertions, by failing to update previously reported information, XXXX is in violation of Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA as well as Sections 463 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( A ) and 464 ( h ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the Higher Education Act ( HEA ). 

The FTC released an advisory opinion which interprets Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA. The issue posed in the advisory opinion is how a lender is to handle a situation when subsequent information updates a report that was allegedly accurate when it was made but no longer is accurate in the present time ( i.e., the identical situation I am currently in ). The advisory opinion states that Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by furnishers, or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRA ) such as the credit bureaus. In  particular, this section requires a person that has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate to promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide any information needed to make it complete and accurate. Thus, on its face, this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally. This duty extends to all student loan accounts reported to CRAs, regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to update accounts as well as to correct. 

Section 463 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( A ) of the Higher Education Act similarly states that an institution shall disclose promptly to such consumer reporting agency any changes to the information previously disclosed. The US Department of Education issued an opinion that stated a retroactive forbearance/deferment acknowledges a period where no payments were due. If no payments were due, then a payment could not be considered late. A payment that was initially reported as being late would need to be changed after the retroactive forbearance/deferment takes effect. This change would legally need to be reported per the above statute and as per Section 464 ( h ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the HEA, which states the institution that made that loan ( or the Secretary, in the case of a loan held by the Secretary ) shall request that any consumer reporting agency to which the default was reported remove the default from the borrowers credit history. 

XXXX representatives told me on XX/XX/XXXX that because the delinquent payments were accurately reported from XXXX of XXXX to XXXX of XXXX, any subsequently initiated deferments would not allow for XXXX to update reports to CRAs to show that the payments were not late and actually in deferment. However, this assertion is error as Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and Sections 463 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( A ) and 464 ( h ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the HEA clearly show that the reports must be updated/corrected regardless of whether they were accurate at one point as they are no longer accurate at this present time due to the retroactive deferment. 

Continuing to report this clearly inaccurate information is in violation of Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) of the FCRA which states a person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate and a person shall not furnish information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if ( i ) the person has been notified by the consumer, at the address specified by the person for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate ; and ( ii ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate. The retroactive deferment granted in XXXX of XXXX nullified any payments that were due and/or missed beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. Since the payments due were nullified ( i.e., no longer due ), there is no possible way that a payment could be considered late at this present time. Reporting that a payment was late when none was due is simply false and inaccurate. A reasonable person would doubt that a payment would still be considered late after a deferment was issued and a reasonable person would also expect that if a deferment was made to be retroactive, any penalties ( including late fees and late payment statuses ) incurred after the effective date would be nullified. 

All of my XXXX  accounts that were late as of XX/XX/XXXX show that my deferment status was effective as of XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, my credit reports do not currently accurately reflect previous payment statuses with XXXX, both as they actually existed and as XXXX has recorded them. I am thus requesting that in compliance with Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA and Sections 463 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( A ) and 464 ( h ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the HEA, that XXXX  be forced to update/correct the four accounts  showing late payments from XXXX of XXXX to XXXX of XXXX. 

Internal XXXX rules and policies can not contradict, counteract, or circumvent the law. Continued inclusion of the erroneous late payment information places XXXX in willful violation of FCRA and HEA. To date, XXXX has refused to make the corrections to my credit report, despite being provided the information mentioned in this complain and being given ample opportunity. The law is clear as is XXXX 's willful disregard for complying with it. At this time, I need help to ensure that this matter is resolved according to the law."
Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX for XXXX the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Advised months ago not to call me during work hours as my company will not allow me to speak with them then ( they can call after XXXX, eastern ) so instead, they looked up my previous credit information and started calling my mother 's number daily starting XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ( who I have not lived with for years ) and then my husband, on XX/XX/18, neither of which is listed as a contact number or a debtor for the account. I spoke with them on XX/XX/18 and made a payment of part of the debt owed, and advised them on the call that I will contact them when I get paid again ( around the XX/XX/XXXX, ) I also asked them to not contact me again during business hours, and asked them to take my husband 's number and my mother 's number off the account, and was told my mother 's number was never on my account to call her, and they did not have another number on file. I received a "" unknown '' call today during my work hours at XXXXXXXX eastern. I used to work in debt collection, I know that they can not contact a customer more than 1 time in a 5 or 7 day period in New York State, and this has been within 3 business days. They need to be able to provide the telephone number when calling, and not purposely avoid caller id features. I advised them again not to contact me during business hours on today 's call, and that I just spoke with them saturday. My mother advised me since then that she has received a call again today on XX/XX/18 from them after I advised them not to call her."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I received a high interest rate loan from XXXX After receiving the funds, I came across the origination fee on the documents sent to me that were in the same amount as the loan. Loan amount approx. {$4600.00}. and origination fee approximately {$5000.00} I contacted the company immediately regarding the fee and the responded that the removed half the the fee. I replied via email Thank you. 
After that email, I was waiting for correspondence from them for payment. I wasn't sure if it changed the amount of the monthly installment or not. 
Previously when I had a loan with this company, they'd either call or text me as a reminder for the payment. 
I received nothing from them via mail, email, phone or text since the reduction for origination fee via email. 
All of a sudden, I go to get a new car and my credit is hit with a charge off from the company in the amount of the loan causing my score to plummet and making it nearly impossible for me to get financed. I ended up with getting a horrible rate due to this scenario.. 
I contact the company and they agreed that there was no proper notice provided to me prior to the credit reporting. No calls from collection or correspondence via mail. I asked why not and they said because it was in a certain department regarding the previous issue. 
Now, they tell me they didn't need to notify me to remind me of payment or to inform me of past due balances and monies due prior to charging off the debt greatly effecting my credit. 
This just doesn't seem accurate to me. Is this true of a high interest rate loan company?"
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Could not pay the loan due to losing job and loss of child support. They have used a third party debt collector to contact my family threatening to serve me with an arrest warrant in the next 30 minutes. They call my phone spoofing my dad 's number so I will pick up and threatening she will be at my house in 15 minutes with an arrest warrant to go to jail. My kids are scared as am I.
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I use MoneyGram to send money to my relatives in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) several times per year. My most recent transfer was on XX/XX/2018. MoneyGram promises a free phone call for the sender to inform the recipient about the transfer and to give the recipient the "" Reference Number '' for the transfer. When I was about to make the free phone call, I noticed that my receipt did not show the information for the free phone call. The XXXX # plus the PIN that's needed to make the phone call were missing. 
The MoneyGram Receipt Jacket has printed instructions on how to make the phone call, and includes the MoneyGram Customer Service phone number. I called the MoneyGram Customer Service phone number to get the PIN number so I could complete the free phone call. I spent more than 15 minutes being taken through several menu items, none of which applied to my issue. When I finally got to speak to a live person, he informed me that I had the wrong number. He gave me a new number for MoneyGram Customer Service ( different from the customer service number on the receipt and on the receipt jacket ). The person who responded to this second number, told me that he could not give me a PIN number, and that I have to go back to the agency ( XXXX XXXX   ) where I made the money transfer. 
When I contacted XXXX XXXX, they said they do not control the giving out of the PIN numbers, or what's printed on the receipt. All this is controlled by MoneyGram. XXXX XXXX took my information and contacted MoneyGram for an explanation of the situation. XXXX XXXX told me that MoneyGram informed them that they had discontinued the free phone calls from XX/XX/2018. However, I found this to be untrue because I sent money from the same agency on XX/XX/2018, and got the free phone call then. There was no notice that the free phone call would be discontinued. 
I find that whenever I need to contact MoneyGram Customer Service, they usually provide false information. They usually give the customer the run-around to avoid taking responsibility for solving a problem. If MoneyGram does not improve on the way they treat customers, they should not be allowed to continue doing business. I pay them {$9.00} to send {$150.00}, and they pay a very low exchange rate in the destination country. So they are making money on both ends. At least, if they discontinue the free phone call, they should have the decency to be upfront with that information, and not mislead customers."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","In XX/XX/2017 I found a promotion through XXXX, where you could receive points for refinancing your student loans through SoFi. I was interested, and applied through the correct link, which brought me to the SoFi website. I applied, and was approved. I called SoFi to confirm that the promotion was on my account, as there had been some back-and-forth since application for additional documents, etc., and was told that indeed I had the promotion and the points would take several months to show up. 

I waited 6-7 months before calling back and asking about the points, which had not yet shown up. SoFi told me that I had used an incorrect link, and so I did not get the promotion. I asked the representative to check call notes, and he confirmed that I called specifically about the promotion, and was told that I would receive it prior to funding my loan. However, as the promotion has since expired, there is "" nothing they can do about it ''. I asked about alternative ways to be made whole, and they are unable and unwilling to do anything. I asked for confirmation of this in writing ( including the notes where I was specifically told I had the promotion, the day before funding my account ) and they are refusing. I would move my loans to another company if it wouldn't adversely affect my credit score/report, but I'm not willing to tarnish my creditworthiness over SoFi 's misrepresentation."

Credit card or prepaid card,"At the time of purchase I was told no interest for 9 months at no time was I informed that this was considered deferred interest on the original purchase. I have been paying well over the minimum balance before the payment due date since Ive owned the card. Only to find out, it didnt matter. I was still charged interest. 

Every month Im battling bills, interest rates, and unforeseen fees on a fixed income. How am I supposed to build my credit back up, if card companies like Synchrony Bank, blindside you with back dated interest?"
Debt collection,"I kept getting written notice from Wakefield & Associates, so I finally asked for validating for this debt they claim I owe. They sent me an itemized summary but no signed contract or hippa release. Which doesn't verify this is mines.

At the time of selecting the 10 year standard plan in XX/XX/XXXX, I was told it would count towards PLSF without the fluctuating payments and need to re-certify each year. I selected this payment as it would eliminate the 1-2 month delay in payments each year while they calculated my payment options, and the small difference in payments on XXXX did not warrant the delay. This option was available as a option to choose on the web site at that time, though it no longer can be found ( and no one notified me if this is true ). When you re-certify each year, they is a delay in payments and I wished to finish paying my loans as quickly as possible. Additionally, in XX/XX/XXXX, I had 85 payments ( I have documentation ). Yet in XXXX I had 75 ( documation available ) I currently have 76 payments, in spite of making 11 payments that were not counted and the indication 23 payments would be added to my account by XXXX towards PLSF. I believe I should have 119 payments. XXXX believes I have 76 payments, and need to make 44 more, and MAYBE could then apply to PLSF ; though one advised this would ONLY count if I now switched to a different payment plan such as REPAYE, but this MIGHT not count as all the payments would not be REPAYE. 

I am extremely frustrated as I am genuinely attempting to make 120 on time payments within a predictable payment plan- and seem to move either backwards or hold still. though maybe this is the intent : for me to make payments forever."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Dear CFPB, I opened a credit card with Capital One in XXXX, and the address on the account was an old rental address of mine in Maryland. I moved from that rental property in XXXX, but the change of address I initiated with the USPS apparently did not report back to Capital One that my address was no longer valid, and Capital One continued to mail all of my information to that address for many years thereafter. I forgot that the card was still active, and it carried a XXXX balance for many years until someone obtained my card in XXXX ( likely someone who lived at the rental I previously occupied ) and fraudulently charged several purchased on the card. The total charges were under {$200.00}. 

After a year of calling in several times to Capital One, to log the dispute, and hearing nothing back, and continuing to see this derogatory information on my credit report, I finally persisted today for hours until someone finally told me that they refused to consider the charges true fraud. 

I also found out that the account was still open, but I had closed earlier this year. 

Additionally, Capital One has changed the account number for my card and is reporting two different card numbers for the same account to the credit bureaus, so that it appears as if I have two seriously delinquent cards with Capital One. 

I asked the fraud manager that I was speaking to, XXXX, what I could do at this point. I asked if I could appeal the decision. She said no. I asked if I could be sent a written explanation of why the charges were not deemed fraud. She denied that request as well. I also asked to speak with her supervisor, and she said there was no supervisor available, even though she was only a manager. 

I was defrauded and I'm being denied any kind of fair process. 

Thank you in advance for any help."
Mortgage,"I called our mortgage company, Ditech, originally to discuss closing paying off our mortgage loan. The representative, XXXX, gave me information on what to do to close the mortgage. At the time he stated that our payoff amount was {$3600.00}. He stated that payments had been made XXXX for {$350.00} and {$360.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX we had paid {$300.00}. We discussed that there were payments being sent from our bill pay during XXXX for {$2000.00} and $ XXXX.if you take {$3600.00} and subtract {$2500.00} you get {$1100.00}. 
In total, I believe I have called Ditech 9 times because their representatives answers were conflicting and at times made no sense. I had discussed with Ditech representatives our intentions of paying off the loan. We made several payments in XXXX. Apparently, instead of putting the payments towards our payoff balance, they put our payments into a funds suspense count without our knowledge or consent. I found this out during one of the conversations with the representatives I spoke with. I had to ask what a funds in suspense was an the answer made no sense to me. They said that it was an account that they place extra funds in like a bank account. Since I verbally stated many times that we were paying off the account, it made no sense. They would tell me that the notes never indicated anything. 

Twice I called and had two representatives tell me that they would have my account closed within 30 days. After the first call, I waited and then called back to check on the account and the next call I made, the representative stated that the account had not been put in to be closed but that she would take it out f our Funds Suspended Account. She promised me that the account would be closed.

I finally called and asked to speak with a manager in XXXX. The representative still wanted to help me and I tried to get the call transferred. It took awhile to get the call transferred to a "" manager '' named XXXX. She put me on hold and reviewed the notes. She told me that all the notes were vague and that she would have to pull the tapes and call me back. She would not give me a last name but gave me the number # XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called We received documentation from Ditech stating that our payoff principal balance would be {$2400.00} but on the next page that our escrow was {$1800.00}. It was dated XX/XX/2018. I called Ditech on that day ( XX/XX/18 ) and spoke with XXXX. I asked XXXX regarding the amounts that were in our mortgage account. I that time, I was quoted the following amounts : Principal Balance : {$2.00}, XXXX Escrow : {$1800.00} Funds in Suspense : {$1700.00} XXXX told me that Ditech could not use our funds in suspense to pay off our last payment which was estimated at {$710.00}. I was told at this time that I needed to write a letter requesting us to use our escrow funds to pay this payment. He told me to include our name, address and account number and fax it to him and XXXX. He let me know that I should have been told by the other representatives that I needed to write a letter. I asked him about disputing funds for paying all the interest since paying all our mortgage and Ditech putting the money and not using it as requested. XXXX told me to hold off until the account was closed to try and dispute this because otherwise it would keep the house from being closed. 

We received an escrow funds reimbursement check in XXXX for {$1100.00}. The statement date was written XX/XX/2018. Later, I got to looking at the statement and it appeared as if it were showing that some of the money for our last payment was supposed to go into escrow and that did not make sense. 

I called Ditech on XX/XX/2018. I waited 30 minutes to talk to someone about our escrow. When questioned about Ditech taking Escrow funds out of our escrow, he told me that our payment came out of the Funds in Suspense Account, the same account that the previous representatives told me that I could not use to pay off our account. 
The gentleman sent me an e-mail with the breakdown of funds, however the print was so small it was illegible. He finally sent me two other forms of our payout history.

When I looked at the breakdown of what he sent us, I noticed what looked like extensive money coming out of our account- 3 transactions in two days. It appears to show that the following transactions came out on XX/XX/2018 : Principle paid : {$480.00} and {$480.00} ; Interest paid : {$14.00} and {$12.00} ; Escrow paid : {$210.00} and {$200.00}. I also noted that on XX/XX/2018 one of the payments they took out was a payment for XX/XX/2018- that would be after the loan was closed. 
On XX/XX/2018 a payment appears to be taken out for the following amounts : Principal Balance {$3400.00} ; Interest {$3.00} and Escrow {$260.00}. I questioned him about these transactions and he assured me that they were all correct. I also questioned him about taking a XX/XX/2018 payment on the closing date of our mortgage ( XX/XX/18 ) and he assured me it was legal and I questioned him how it was legal. He finally said, "" hello '' and I responded with "" please don't do this to me '' and then he quickly said "" hello, hello, hello. Due to no response, I have to terminate this call ''."
Checking or savings account,"Capital One us involved in a dispute with my employer. As a result, as of XX/XX/XXXX, they have been retaliating against employees such as myself, by preventing us from accessing the bank 's website for any purpose whatsoever -- including online banking. The computer which my employer issues me is my primary device and it is permanently connected to my office network, which means that constructively, I am perpetually blocked from accessing online banking. 

Capital One is blocking users such as myself from accessing online banking for wholly inappropriate, completely unrelated reasons unrelated to my activity as a customer. Furthermore, because their mobile application is not functionally equal to their online banking portal, they have given me no equivalent recourse. 

Through my employer, I have raised this issue directly with senior management at Capital One ( VP Enterprise Digital Products, and Sr Digital Product Management ), and my employer has specifically guaranteed that only employee-customer traffic will be sent to their office. Nowhere in Capital One 's online banking agreement is this condition imposed in order for me, a private customer, to access my account. However, Capital One has not accepted these terms and continues to block employees such as myself, who are also customers."
Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX I went to the Auto Dealership, ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX ) to roll my lease into a purchase. I met with the salesperson who I used to purchase the lease in XX/XX/XXXX to talk about what options I would have to buy the car. He told me he would have to submit the information for approval since I am retired and on a fixed income. Later on that afternoon he called me back and said that I got approved @ a 9 % interest rate. Later on I XXXX "" Interest rates on used cars '' and the current standard industry is around 4.5 %. The next day ( today ) XX/XX/XXXX I went back into the dealership to see if I could negotiate a more reasonable interest rate since I felt like they were gouging me. At one point during our conversation with the counter person who handles the loans the sales person looked at him as we were discussing the loan and said ... Isn't the rate@ 9.5 %? Yesterday it was 9 % and today it is 9.5 %? We continued on for a while and the counter person said ... It isn't us it is the main XXXX XXXX XXXX company that is setting the interest rate. A few minutes later we were still haggling and he said ... '' What do you want a point off ''? After that I started thinking if it was XXXX XXXX XXXX and not the Local Dealership were I was at making the decision on the interest rate ... Why would he be making that statement? He also mentioned that if I had a job he could get me a lower interest rate? Isn't that discrimination in lending? Why should I be treated any different than anyone else? I have been in this lease almost 3 years and have never missed a payment. Also the counter person kept mentioning that it was them ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) not us setting the interest rate. I also have a credit score of over XXXX. So I just found this on XXXX ...

Hope you can help me with this as it saddens me that a reputable Corporation would want to gouge their customers just because they think that their behavior is appropriate. Anyway, thanks for your time and help."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for the Citi AAdvantage Platinum Select card through the XXXX XXXX website because they offered a {$250.00} statement credit on XXXX XXXX purchases if approved for card when applying on XXXX XXXX website. I called Citi bank on XX/XX/XXXX to see if I will get the credit before I booked a {$270.00} flight with the card. The representative said she put in a request for me to get the credit and it was a guarantee that I would get the {$250.00} credit and it will show up on my bill before my first payment was due ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Because the representative said I would get the {$250.00} credit, I booked the flight shortly after our conversation. Since then, I have spoken to numerous representatives from Citi on the phone and received 2 letters in the mail saying my account is in fact, NOT eligible for the {$250.00} credit. Now that my credit card bill is due 2 days from now ( on XX/XX/XXXX ), I am paying {$250.00} more than I was expecting to pay because of the misinformation given to me. My buying the flight was contingent on getting a {$250.00} statement credit so had the representative told me the correct information in the first place that I was not eligible or that it was just a possibility, I would have done something different with my money when buying the flight and in the mean time. Now, I have a bill that I was not expecting to pay and can not afford because I was told I would absolutely, 100 % get the credit. I have spoken to many people from Citi and XXXX XXXX about this and they have not helped me. The representative from XXXX XXXX said that because I was told I would get the credit, they would honor what they said and give it to me and I still have been denied it. I am very unhappy that I was told the wrong information and now I have to pay a very large bill because of the employees at Citi."

Checking or savings account,"Forty eighXXXX years ago, my husband and I opened a savings and checking account with XXXX XXXX   XXXX. Over the years, I opened several more accounts at the bank and the bank has changed hands three times. These accounts were my primary accounts and they grew substantially to include our household savings and checking, our children 's savings and college acoounts, and a trust account. With each change of banks, I made sure that all of my accounts would be tied together so that I did not have to pay any fees and this was the case until recently. We had as many as eight accounts at the bank and never had a problem. Over the years, I have spoken to bank representatives about my accounts and I was assured that all the accounts were linked so that our substantial balance would preclude any fees. A while ago, I received a letter from the current bank, Santander, notifying me that I would be charged {$1.00} per month on my trust accounts because they were inactive. I promptly went into the bank and spoke with the branch manager. He reversed the charge and I was not charged that fee again. 

When I retired in XXXX, I had the time to closely scrutinize my bank statements. I was very surprised to see that I was being chraged {$30.00} a month on the trust accounts. I had never received a letter informing me that this would be done. Instead, a blanket statement was printed on monthly statements. Since I had always been told that my substantial balances at the bank would preclude any fees, I did not think that this generic statement applied to me. The trust accounts were only a few XXXX dollars below the minimum required for the fee to be waived on those accounts, while the aggregate amount of all of my accounts was significantly higher than the minimum required balances. I could have easily transferred that amount into the trust accounts if I had been notified of pending fees by the bank. And, for a while I was also charged a {$3.00} monthly fee for a paper statement for the trust accounts. Since I am well over 65 years of age, this violated bank policy and was later recinded. But I had to bring it to the bank 's attention when they certainly had the information in their records. 
Once I became aware of the charges, I went to the bank and spoke with a representative. He assured me that he would handle the situation At one point, he told me that my accounts should have been "" grandfathered ''. While he was doing this, Santander continued to charge my account. The branch manager did credit my account for those charges but she has a limit of {$100.00} and these charges had gone on for 5 years. So, there is a significant amount that was not returned to my account. 

The local bank representatives referred me to the district executive. After speaking with her several times, she told me that she would refund {$500.00} as a courtesy because of my longstanding relationship with the bank. When I once again told her that I had been assured by a number of bank employees that I would not be charged any fees because of my substantial bank balances, she told me that none of the people with whom I had spoken were still with the bank so she was not going to honor what they had assured me about my accounts! I was told by my branch representative that I needed to keep the accounts in question open so that the {$500.00} would be deposited. The bank continued to charge me the monthly fees which the local branch credited back to my account. Finally, after 2 months, I closed the trust accounts. I am presently in the process of moving all of my accounts out of Santander Bank. This has been a major inconvenience for me. The bank should refund the {$30.00} monthly charge that has been deducted from my account since XXXX, XXXX."
Mortgage,"Regions bank is breaking the law. My house was damaged by hurricane IRMA in XXXX. 

Since Florida has been declared a federal disaster area, which means, by law I can get a forbearance payment on my FHA mortgage. 

When I contacted regions in XX/XX/XXXX about my repair cost due to hurricane IRMA preventing me to be able to pay on time they offered a repayment plan not a forbearance plan.

The repayment plan is that I only skip one month of payments and then pay extra payments every month for 4 months until the loan is current. Thats not a practical solution. And I requested a different strategy and was denied.

And not only that they never mentioned to me that not making the one month payment would be reported to credit agencies and a missed delinquent payment."

I contacted the bank and the agreed to fax the documents to the GAP insurance company and send me a copy in the mail. This was around XX/XX/XXXX. I waited two weeks and contacted the GAP insurance and they had received the Statement of Payments, but not the original loan agreement. I then called the bank again and requested the original loan agreement be faxed to the GAP insurance and the 2 documents sent in the mail to me. 
The interest rate on the original document was different than the rest of the documents, so the GAP insurance requested a APR Rate Difference letter from Huntington Bank. I called Huntington Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the document would be processed that day. I talked to the GAP insurance on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they had not received the APR Difference Letter yet. I called Huntington Bank again and was told that this letter takes 4 days to process! I then called Huntington Bank again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that it would take 5 days! In this process, my account has been reported to the Credit Bureaus as delinquent.

I would always consult with the lenders first and ask if they looked at individual income or household income when determining my qualifications for the consolidation loan. Of the half a dozen or so other lenders I have previously spoken with they were all very clear that their income qualifications were based around individual income and not household income. After speaking with this company in question, however, I was told that they look at household income and not just individual income. So I went through the lengthy application process only to be denied after several weeks of review. When I asked for clarification, they said that I was denied based on my income.

Mortgage,"We paid our Bank of America mortgage in full in XX/XX/2018, and sold the house as-is the same month. All liens were cleared, and the closing was successful. The house had been flooded in the Hurricane Harvey flood, but due to the insurance settlement being less than the estimated cost to repair the house, we decided to sell the house as-is. 
Since then, Bank of America has sent letters to me demanding that we set up an inspection on this house to be sure repairs have been made. I phoned Bank of America two days ago and explained that we paid the loan in full ( the Bank of America representative acknowledged this ), that we no longer own the house, and that we did not make a claim on this house with Bank of America prior to selling the house. 
The Bank of America representative became robotic ( i.e. acting as if I had not said anything ). Thinking this may be a computer, I began to repeat myself. After the phone call, I went on the Bank of America website and filed a complaint explaining the problem. 
Today I received a phone call from a different Bank of America representative. I explained how Bank of America is harassing me on this matter, and repeated we paid the loan in full, that we no longer own the house, and that we did not make a claim on this house with Bank of America prior to selling the house. She demanded more personal information from me. I explained that this is an internal matter for Bank of America to resolve, and I will not provide any other information over the phone. Like  the other representative, she began to repeat herself much like a computer would do. I requested a letter in lieu of a phone call, but she would not agree to this over the phone. 
I need Bank of America to cease harassing me given they acknowledge the loan is paid in full, Bank of America has no lien on the home, we no longer own this property, and we did not file a claim on the property with Bank of America. It is illegal for use to schedule an inspection on a property we do not own, but Bank of America does not acknowledge this."

She told me to work on my credit while I waited for the bankruptcy to come off and we would revisit a pre-approval at the end of XXXX or the beginning of XXXX.

When I spoke to her a few days later she told me that she had made a mistake because she forgot I had student loans. We did a three-way-call with XXXX, XXXX and I. XXXX and XXXX suggested that I wait until XX/XX/XXXX and they would run all of my information back through the computer and it show generated a pre-approval letter at that time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received another pre-approval letter for a FHA loan with a deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. My realtor and I went out looking out houses again. I found a house at XXXX XXXX XXXX We began the process of purchasing the home with a estimated close date by XX/XX/XXXX. I did my first loan application on XX/XX/XXXX. I gave my apartment complex a notice to vacate on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid for a home inspection on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$320.00}. I got a quote for home insurance on XX/XX/XXXX. Then I was told that I would need a co-borrower. XXXX spoke to my Father about being a co-borrower. My Father declined because he is close to retiring from his employment. There was talk about my Father placing the house in his name and then eventually doing a FHA Streamline Refinance. The problem with that was my Father 's name was not on the original agreement. Next he ran my Mother 's credit and her score was too low. Last, he ran my sister 's credit and added her to the loan. When my sister was added to the loan, I was generated a denial letter on XX/XX/XXXX. In that letter my credit was checked again for the second time on XX/XX/XXXX. Then my sister and I were told that she had a student loan in the amount of {$2000.00} that was in default on her credit report. We were advised to have her reach out to the agency and arrange payments. Once payments were arranged, they would send her a letter and we could proceed. My sister did as we were advised. We sent the letter of payment arrangements to XXXX and he then told us that we needed a letter stating the loan was removed from default. My sister contacted the credit agency and they informed her that they would not remove the loan from default until she made at least 3 payments on time. She then inquired how soon she would get a letter if she paid it in full. The told her it would still take 3 months. At this point we were days away from closing. I reached out to XXXX to advise him of what we had been told by the agency. He stated that we would need to close the loan process because it would be denied and there was nothing else we could do. The loan was supposed to be closed on XX/XX/XXXX. Almost 2 weeks had gone by and I never received a denial letter so I reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. He told me that the file was in the denial process already and it should be out soon. I was confused because I was under the impression that the loan had already been denied. 

All of this left me in a bad position and I could have been homeless. I had already given my apartment complex a notice to vacate, so they could have made me move and I had a child younger than one at the time. My apartment complex was going to raise my rent, but since I had been here so long that extended my lease. I also, missed out of the chance to rent the house I was trying to purchase because the seller had the option to rent and I could have revisited the option to buy within a year. The seller ended up placing the house back on the market to sell. This could have also resulted in me paying for movers twice. Once to move somewhere else then again to move once I was in the position to buy. 

This whole process started in XX/XX/XXXX and ended in at the end on XX/XX/XXXX. After seven months, two pre-approval letters, three dings on my credit and three potential co-borrows, I am still no closer to owning my own home. Also, upon reaching out to another Mortgage Officer I was advised that I would have never been approved for a FHA due to the fact that I have student loans and that loan goes by 1 % of that debt. This would always cause be to be over my debt to income ratio. I feel as if my realtor and I wasted a lot of unnecessary time and effort, looking at houses, gathering information and phone calls."
Student loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX i was informed from my parents that Navient loans from the department of education called. They left a voicemail stating that i was past due on payments from their department ; stating that i was supposed to start making payments the beginning of XXXX. I am in the military ; when i left for the military it was in an agreement that i would be on an XXXX XXXX military deferment until XX/XX/XXXX. Since being in the military i have taken college courses paid for by the XXXX XXXX. Being that i have taken college classes, Navient reactivated my student loans. I never received any mail from Navient. They said they have sent me multiple emails, emails which where being sent to an email used by XXXX XXXX XXXX College ; which i no longer have access to. After receiving the voicemail on XX/XX/XXXX I called Navient immediately. They fixed my missed payments and put my account on hold until XX/XX/XXXX. The next day I checked my credit score,  seeing that my score dropped from XXXX down to XXXX, due to 90 days missed payments. I called Navient customer service, explained the situation. Then I was transferred again to the military department within Navient. I again explained my situation with the credit report, not receiving emails, only receiving the one voicemail left on our home phone number on XX/XX/XXXX. The customer service representative gave me the run around and said, there was nothing they could do to fix the issue once reported since it was accurate information. Now i am seeking help to solve this issue. If I knew student loans opened after taking XXXX  college courses, I would have made sure to pay them on time and not miss any payments. Since I was never notified effectively, I could not ensure that this was taken care of."
Debt collection,"The representative called us and presented himself as a "" mediator '' and discussed arbitration proceedings. When asked if he was a court-appointed mediator, and if not, what company he worked for, he avoided the ( repeated ) question, he quickly hung up. It took two call backs for them to identify themselves as "" XXXX XXXX, '' a debt collection agency. They were attempting to collect a debt owned by Perfection Collection, which was originally owned by a security company, XXXX."
Mortgage,"We are in the middle of a short sale review with Wells Fargo, the mortgage servicer when suddenly, a foreclosure date was assigned on the house as recent as last week. We already sent over all the pertinent documents as of XX/XX/18 and had been working directly with the short sale negotiator as of XX/XX/18. Wells Fargo did not order a full interior value and only ordered the exterior value which came back highly inflated from actual market values of the local neighborhood. Without the interior value, the Investor of the loan does not have an accurate picture of the house 's condition. We were told to submit a value dispute packet in order to re-review the file if an interior value request would be acceptable. We submitted the value dispute immediately at the same time that the Homeowner received a foreclosure notice. When we requested that Wells Fargo postpone the foreclosure date since we are in the middle of a short sale review. Wells Fargo is refusing to postpone the foreclosure date, despite knowing that a value dispute review itself could take up to 15 business days to complete and not to mention, the amount of time it takes to go through a counter offer phase and then, approval."
Debt collection,"A False claim of collections has been on my financial records for over two years. 

A false claim was reported to the Simmons Collection Agency. 

The Buisness ( a dance studio ) falsified records stating that I paid tuition for my XXXX children to take "" recreational dance ''. This is not true. My Children were selected and I enrolled them, and paid for in full at the beginning of the year for the required classes for Competative Dance. 

I alerted them ( The Simmons Agency ) that the collection was false MANY TIMES. 

We hired a lawyer to communicate to the Collections Agency and the buisness it represents the Debt and impending Collections was fraudulent. 

I have calledSimons Agency many times. It has been almost 3 years of communication! 

Today I sent in even more supporting documentation asking them to take it off my credit report immediately. 

The Dance Studio that has made this Collection has falsified records and is being vindictive because they did not want to refund funds that they owe me including tuition, competition fees and costume fees. This is a false claim on my fanancial record!. It is on my credit report and is causing continual financial harm. We did not "" drop '' dance classes as states in the contract. The girls were kicked off the Team in the middle of the Competition Season, after we paid for all fees, costumes and tuitions, in full, upfront."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am having an ongoing dispute with Kohls department stores. I did not receive a statement in XX/XX/XXXX consequently the account fell delinquent and was reported to the credit bureau for being late. I caught up my payment in XXXX then in XXXX did not receive another statement again. Having 40+ accounts I pay monthly I did not realize that the statement did not arrive. When a Kohls representative called me on an XXXX recorded line to inform me of my late payment after confirming my identity she questioned me on my address. She asked me if I lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX, I explained to her no I did not I live at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Her response was oh lets change that. I asked her if she had to XXXX XXXX XXXX as my mailing address and she confirm to me that yes she indeed did. I further went on to suggest that because they had the wrong address I should not be held accountable for the in accurate information reported to the credit bureau as I have never lived at that address and Ive only lived at this address for 6+ years. The representative assured me that she would notify the credit reporting agencies that they had inaccurate information and that it was an internal kohls error and Would rectify the situation. She suggested that I contact the credit reporting agencys & file a dispute which I did. Several weeks later I received a letter from Kohls stating that the information that was reported to the credit bureau agencies was correct no changes would be made. As a result of this erroneous error my credit score has dropped 53 points. And my previous OnTime payment history that used to be 100 % is now at 99 %. It is important to note that I have had this account since XX/XX/XXXX with no previous late fees and no negative or delinquent payment & To date this is the only negative remark on my entire credit report. Prior to that I have never had any incidences of late fees or negative reporting to the credit reporting agencies. Kohls refuses to rectify the problem, it is unfair to me as a consumer that my credit should drop 53 points and I should have this negative information that is an accurate on my credit report. I am considering legal action and I today am meeting with a attorney to secure counsel to begin the process of taking them to court to file for punitive damages and defamation. I really dont want that I only want the negative tomorrow marks removed from my credit report. Any help that you can supply is greatly appreciated. It is also important to note that I have contacted the residents Who reside at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and have asked them if they ever received letters from Kohls for me and they confirmed that they have. Since they did not know the person whos mail that was they just discarded it in the trash they have agreed to write up a document stating that and once I have that I will submit that as further proof that indeed the mail billing statements was truly sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX mass in correctly. 

I may be reached at area code XXXX and my email address is XXXX Thank you for your time and your attention to this matter and I hope that you can be of some assistance to me as I go through this complicated process. Its very frustrating to say the least.

Mortgage,"To whom it may concern. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Loan Modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( attached ). This document was submitted and accepted by both parties ( myself and XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
This Loan Modification ( attached ) was very clear about ALL the payments and dates with included a deferred balance until XX/XX/XXXX ( also noted as maturity date on the loan ). 
I was making the payments regularly as agreed on the Loan Modification. 
Everything was going as contracted and no communication was ever sent to me about any error or problem with the above mentioned loan. 
The payments and the maturity date of the loan were very specific and I had no reason to believe otherwise. 
This Loan was purchased by SETERUS in XX/XX/XXXX I believe. ( Not sure about this date but its irrelevant on this matter ). 
All of a sudden ( XX/XX/XXXX ) my payments began to reflect as "" payment in suspense '' and my access on line was not reflecting any regular payments. ( Note that I was making the payments every month on a regular bases ). SETERUS did not send any communication or any type of warning about any problems or that the loan would have any kind attention of my part. In reality I was the one the start calling them on a regular bases and had no response for a long time ; at least once a week a have been calling them ( Has been 3 years now - Probably at least over 100 calls ... ). 
SETERUS DEMANDED SOME PAYMENTS ABOVE AND BEYOND THE ORIGINAL LOAN MODIFICATION - ( ATTACHED LETTER AS EXAMPLE OF MANY ) AND MAYBE THATS WHY THE FIRST LOAN BECAME PAID AS THEY SAY. 
Around XX/XX/XXXX SETERUS began to return my payments ( Total of 7 payments ) and after XX/XX/XXXX SETERUS began to refuse payments. AT THIS TIME SETERUS BEGAN TO REQUEST FULL PAYMENT OF THE DEFFERED BALANCE - APROX XXXX XXXX DOLLARS AS NOTED ON ATTACHED LETTER. I have no access on line to make any payments nor can I make the payments over the phone. 
After a long process of calls and letters ( Including letters from a lawyer XXXX XXXX - also attached ) I was offered a Loan Modification Assistance ( attached ). This trial offer had payments 7 times bigger than the original Loan Modification and the terms were only 15 years instead of 30 to 40 years like I was informed over the phone many times from Customer Service at SETERUS. I sent a letter in response ( Attached ),  and for many weeks waited for an answer. 
After another long wait I am still waiting on a response from SETERUS and just received a letter from SETERUS on  XX/XX/XXXX ( Also attached ) saying that they are still analyzing. I decided to call and hear from them what was happening because mean time I had got a call before ( XX/XX/XXXX ) from a supervisor and he told me that the offer was made as an error and in reality they could not even offer me any kind of loan to make the Deferred Amount of  approx. XXXX K, the amount they have been requesting since they start sending my payments back and also refusing to take any more regular payments as agreed on the Original Loan Documents. As usual I had confusing response and was told the same thing as before that I had to pay the full amount or try to find another institution to refinance my loan. 
Resuming : SETERUS without any warning decided that the Original Loan Modification from XXXX XXXX XXXX were no longer be honored by them because the first part of the loan was almost paid off ( possibly because they requested extra payments several times ) and again ; without any type of communication or warning began to send payments back and then stop receiving them completely. 
No solution was proposed from SETERUS and they are threatening to foreclosure. This house is my only property and we have no means to sell and still have enough to move to another place. 
There is a lot more to be written and a lot more documents to be uploaded but I don't want to make this too long. I will be able to provide more documents and written explanations for what is happening. My goal is to resolve this matter and be able to go on with my regular life.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I received a notification today that Chase was increasing my interest rate from 11.24 % to 16.24 % simply because as stated on the letter, because the existing APRs are below the lowest APRs we currently offer. On the front and back of the letter, for everyone to see was the following statement : Important Information Enclosed Changes to Your Account. First, I am not happy that they have just decided after 13 years, that they need to gouge me with an interest rate of 16.24 % which is absolutely unconscionable in todays market. If they routinely charge their best customers that type of interest rate, I would hate to have missed a payment in those 13 years. I can only imagine how high the rate could go in that situation. Anyway, back to the letter. As I understand the privacy rules, Chase should be protecting my information, not publishing the fact that I have an account with their bank on the front of a mailing for the world to see. This was not even in an envelope, it was a Tri-Folded paper barely glued on the ends. Inside was the last 4 digits of my account. Anyone who knows anything about credit cards could quickly determine 12 of the 16 digits of my account simply by using one of Chases BIN and  the last four digits they provided in this very insecure mailing. That leaves only 4 digits to figure out. How long would it take for a computer to crack the code on that one? This was a very important notice. This is a notice that Chase should have to prove that the customer received. The fact that they just mailed it does not prove that a consumer recieved it. To be honest, I almost threw it away because it looked like junk mail. This is a change in the contract, not an adjustment based on the terms of the contract, but a change in the basic contract itself. Finally, I understand that Chase has itself covered from a legal standpoint on the interest rate adjustment, but I find it a very unfair practice to only adjust rates in one direction, that being up. Would it not be more fair to all the other consumers who have paid their accounts on time to recieve an interest rate reduction since obviously prime plus 5.99 % is more than a fair rate? I have closed the account with Chase because that was the only way not to have the rate increased, but this is not a fair way to treat consumers. Note that the attachment shows the condition of the notice as it was recieved."

On XX/XX/XXXX the entire {$430.00} went to interest. I contacted Navient, first representative, XXXX, put me on hold and disconnected me. I call back the representative, XXXX XXXX, not sure of spelling, told me because I made the payment early, there was 40 days of interest that had accrued and this is way they took the entire payment for interest. I told him the payment is not due until the XXXX and he said it did not matter. I am not a fool and this is a lie. I have been making my payments on time and Navient allocates they payments the way the chose. I know about the lawsuit filed against them, so I am not the only person.

Mortgage,"I opened this case on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells fargo closed the case yesterday XX/XX/XXXX without addressing any of ours concerns from Number ( 1 ) sale of our house on XX/XX/XXXX to lawsuit to reinstate our loan which was not done. I need answers to my concerns as listed below. I need answers to the dates and amounts that I mentioned below. 

1 ) Dual Tracking : In XX/XX/XXXX, Wellsfargo was processing our loan modification without removing our property foreclosure. Agent were telling us documents to fax in which we did but foreclosure sale date was not moved or stopped. As foreclosure sale date was set, I was quoted {$120000.00} to reinstate the loan, take care of escrow balance ; attorney fees and all other delinquency fees. Provided Wells Fargo proof of funds from the bank to extend sale date or remove sale date but Wells Fargo proceeded to sell my property on XX/XX/XXXX, after speaking to my bank manager who confirmed availability of funds.

2 ) We hired an attorney who sued Wells Fargo but Wells Fargo reached an agreement that if we should agree to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice, Wells Fargo will reinstate the loan as it was and credit all payments, past due escrow balance, taxes and insurance to bring account current with no extra charges. A payment of {$130000.00} as settlement amount. 
3 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo signed the settlement agreement upon the receipt of {$130000.00} in lieu of rescind the sale, reinstate the loan to current status, take care of escrow account and resume account activities. 4 ) Wells fargo did not keep up their side of the deal because the payment of {$130000.00} was not properly credited to the account to take care past due escrow, payments, taxes, and insurance as was listed in the the detailed statement that was sent to us in XX/XX/XXXX regarding why {$130000.00}. 5 ) Wells Fargo did not reinstate the loan as it was where Wells Fargo pays our taxes and insurance as we had requested and how it was prior to settlement of lawsuit but instead Wells Fargo added forced escrow to our loan and did not provide detailed account of how and our payment of {$130000.00} was disbursed. This caused them to do wrongful escrow analysis on our loan thereby tripling our mortgage payments and making it unable for us to make our payments. 6 ) Wells Fargo also falsified interest only modification which we never requested and stated that our loan was an interest only loan when statements that was provided by Wells Fargo attorneys during lawsuit settlement in XXXX clearly showed our property as ARM and not interest only. 7 ) Our original loan was taking out in the year XXXX in the amount of {$240000.00}. As of today, Wells Fargo has turned our lives to a nightmare with the falsified interest only modification which puts our payoff amount to {$350000.00}, our monthly payment form {$1200.00} to {$5600.00}. We have asked wellsfargo to let us know what our monthly payment was before the modification and how many payments were we past due to have requested interest only loan from an arm and how much difference was our payments before interest only and after interest only loan because we never signed for interest only modification, it is falsified. This is our primary resident for over 15years. It is not an investment property to be interest only."
Debt collection,"this complaint is continue for the case XXXX which was filed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After the first complaint filed, the bank did contacted me and told me they are working on it, and transferred my case to their searching department. I was happy with their response. but they are very slow as they responded to this case like around 60 days. I also made my XX/XX/XXXX payment which I should pay and received on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I requested payment history, but I never received it from the bank. what they are doing is trying to collect the debt I didn't own. 

I can wait if they are doing searching, but their collect department keeps bothering me and my wife, trying to collect the money which I should not pay, it already interrupt our regular daily life. they don't have any communication between different deportment. their searching department response is very slow, but their collection depart is too active. 

If they couldn't resolve the issue with short time, please ask their collect deportment stop collecting the debt before they finish their searching job. Here I updated the supporting material in the attachment."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",There is unauthorized inquiries on my report that were supposed to be removed 3 months ago and are still there so my issue has not been resolved.
Checking or savings account,XX/XX/2018 I had a transaction through the XXXX option of my Citibank app for {$250.00} USD for a cellphone from a website called XXXX XXXX XXXX which is now down for maintenance. I ordered the device it was supposed to be received on that same day by their courier. Never was received due to high volume of orders and will be delivered or XXXX pick up whichever I decided on. I decided to schedule a XXXX pickup and never was emailed back to proceed the option. I decided to dispute this. I called the number it says call rejected. I emailed them and got a response with an email back saying it will be refunded at XXXX PST I never received the funds and called my bank after I couldnt contact the company of the cellphone anymore. The website says for question or information email XXXX so I emailed them and no response. So thats when I called my bank again and they said I had to fix this with the company which I did mention to them is not corresponding to my issue. Citibank did not help at all to retrieve my funds back after a fraudulent activity towards a promise to refund.
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX I setup a transfer of {$50.00} to my niece in Illinois for her birthday.

I was told the the transaction was cancelled by MoneyGram ; however, no reason was given. I've sent her money before with no issues, but for some reason that transaction was flagged, but the representative couldn't explain why. I asked for a supervisor and was told the same thing. I now have to wait 3 to 10 business days for them to send my money back to my bank account. I wanted an explanation why they took my money, cancelled the transaction and now I have to wait so long to get my money back. Neither rep could explain except to repeat that MoneyGram is an international money transfer company that reviews transactions and flags them for cancellation. I still do not know why it was cancelled as I've sent her money before, we have the same last name and it was only {$50.00}. And I really don't understand why I have to wait 3 to 10 business days for my money when it didn't take that long for them to take my money for the transfer.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX TD Bank ( XXXX Branch Number XXXX ) prepared and sent an International outgoing wire to XXXX , XXXX XXXX deducting {$9800.00} from my account to do so. On XX/XX/XXXX the recipient stated it had not arrived. So I had TD do a trace to find the wire. They stated it was at XXXX bank and may be held while funds converted. When the recipient could not trace from their end I requested a recall of the wire. In all cases there was no response from the XXXX bank ( if it was there ). 
From then XX/XX/XXXX until now XX/XX/XXXX no response from XXXX bank is the only report I get when I call. Frustrating is no one wants to help and requests for escalation are ignored. Evidently no one is skilled enough to trace and retrieve. 
The recipient was sent copies to trace from their end and their bank said no wire with those dates and amount was found. 
I feel this wire is in limbo or maybe a false image out there in the system. 
How can their be so little knowledge or skill if a bank is providing this service No one wants to help. I call XXXX XXXX and wait while the rep calls Wire Dept. the answer is always the same : nothing can be done, it is the XXXX Bank holding the money."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I have previously submitted a complaint against Wells Fargo. # XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. The company researched the complaint and then closed it before it was resolved. They still owe me {$160.00} for an unjustified finance charge dated XX/XX/XXXX. The representative who researched my case lied when she said she could not find documentation relating to this charge. She sent me a copy of the research and the document containing the {$160.00} finance charge was included. This case needs to be reopened and Wells Fargo needs to reimburse me {$160.00} which they fraudulently took from me. They had on NO occasion informed me that there was ANY finance charge. The account had never had a late payment or non-payment. It was paid IN FULL with a clearly printed XXXX balance. Yet, the bank officer forced me to make the payment or they would keep the account open against my will."
Debt collection,"I have contacted Equifax  several times via phone online, and via first class mailings on many occasions in regard to an account that was placed in my name that did not belong to me and that I did not authorize, and I am not familiar with.

I am trying to refinance something on my credit report and it makes it difficult when theyre checking credit, and I have numerous accounts that does not belong to me reporting inaccurately. I have disputed and reached out to XXXX several times and they say the same thing over and over. The companies either need to send proof or validation or it needs to be removed. These accounts do not belong to me. I've done the FTC Identity theft report ( XXXX ), I've called Equifax and they've told me that their handling it and they received proper paperwork and I should see an update and I never do.

The following accounts are what is being reported : ( XXXX XXXX ) # XXXX account number. I also want the following unauthorized inquiries from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX  XXXX removed.

Vehicle loan or lease,"I have recieved our monthly statement on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed that there was an extra payment on there that was not made by my husband or myself. I called Citizens One Auto Finance to figure out what happened and why there was an extra payment. When talking to customer service, they informed me that the payment made was on XX/XX/XXXXonline and the card was saved to the account. At this point I asked to speak to a supervisor because I did not approve this payment. The supervisor had helped remove the card while I was on the phone with her. I had asked her what name was on the card and she informed me that it was in my name and appeared to be a debit card. While visiting with her, I had asked for the information on the card ( bank information and the rest of the card number, expiration date ) they would not give me the information because they do not have it. That was the end of the call on this date. I called back the next day and spoke with customer service supervisor again and they had already started doing the reversal payment on the card ending in XXXX ( which I am not the card holder on, nor do I have the card ). I had explained to them that I have the right to this information, especially with the card being in my name and trying to figure out if it is identity theft. I told the supervisor that the only people that have my account information should be my husband, myself and their bank. To make an online payment you need to have the following information : account number and the last 4 of your social security number."
Mortgage,"My loan payoff was requested on XX/XX/XXXX, per the customer service rep with Oceanside Mortgage Company -- XXXX XXXX XXXX I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX there was a 10 day hold placed on the account so no payments would be sent out. Only XX/XX/XXXX an insurance premium payment was sent out for {$470.00}. This does not align with the 10 day "" hold '' that my account was placed on. I sold my home, closing date on XX/XX/XXXX and received the profit the same day via check. The customer service rep stated that my account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX another payment was made for {$410.00} to pay my MIP insurance to XXXX XXXX, per the same customer service rep XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a copy of the MIP statement to see proof that payment was in fact necessary and owed and was refused a copy, stating it was electronic and not something they received or could look at to reference. The balance of my escrow account belongs to me and the insurance payment should not have been made as the account was on "" hold '' from the payoff request. After requesting the refund of the escrow balance I was also refused a copy of the bill they received in XX/XX/XXXX and were required by law to pay to XXXX XXXX for the MIP. The only thing they would provide me was a copy of the Underwriting paperwork that was created when I bought the home in XX/XX/XXXX"
Checking or savings account,"My original bank was taken over by First Citizens Bank based in XXXX NC. Since this was the second time my bank was taken over by another bank, I've been submitting my deposits by mail because my local branch was closed. I had several mailed in deposits work as expected. But on XX/XX/XXXX I mailed 6 personal checks and 1 business check to the same address, using the same deposit slips I had used previously, in one envelope. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked and those deposits still were not recorded in my personal or business checking account. I called to find out why and was assured they would show up soon. After I mailed the checks to their branch in XXXX, it was decided they would send them on to XXXX. That caused a delay. On XX/XX/XXXX, they sent a letter saying my 1 business check had been delayed because I used a deposit slip that didn't have their name on it. They ultimately processed it, but that was the cause of the delay. There was no communication about the 6 personal checks that were in the same envelope. I called many times, trying to get this resolved. I also communicated many times with their research department, via their website. I'll attach those conversations for your review. In one of my desperate phone calls a customer service person who refused to give me her name, assured me that if I faxed them the photocopies of the missing checks, they would process them, just as they do mobile deposits. I followed her instructions, followed up with more phone calls, and finally received a letter ( which I'll attach ), telling me this is mine to fix. I need to call each person that issued me the checks ( I don't even know these people and have no phone numbers for them ) and tell them they need to stop payment on those checks and issue new ones. First Citizens Bank have all the information they need to process these checks but refuse to do so. The letter from them was not even signed and didn't include any phone number for me to reply."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a refrigerator and I qualified for {$6000.00} no interest for 24 months credit card that I'd be able to utilize anywhere.

According to the policy, the company was supposed to replace the refrigerator in a quick manner, which was not respected, we were without a refrigerator for 50 days. The insurance covered {$280.00} for the food that spoiled in the refrigerator. By XX/XX/XXXX the account balance had gone up to {$10000.00} and they had already cancelled my card. I kept calling the company but they wouldn't answer my calls. On XX/XX/XXXX they answered me and the representative I spoke to said that if I made a {$1000.00} payment my account would go back to it's rightful amount of about {$5000.00}. Therefore, I made a {$1000.00} payment and my balance is still {$7000.00} and requesting a {$840.00} deferred payment.

Credit card or prepaid card,"-On XX/XX/2018 I informed Capital One about one of the transactions of {$610.00} that I had made with XXXX regarding filing a dispute. 

- I informed them that XXXX did not provide the services for which I paid and that they had agreed that they are going to refund me the amount after corresponding and taking up the issue with them. 

- Since they had not refunded me the amount, I want to proceed with filing the chargeback. 

- On XX/XX/2018 I saw the transaction charged again on my credit card. 

- Upon my inquiry I was told that I had to submit the documents with regards to my correspondence with XXXX and their agreement of refunding on it. 

- On XX/XX/XXXX I provided Capital One with necessary evidence to pursue the transaction with the merchant. 

- The confirmed the successful receipt of the documents. And that they will not require anything more at this point. Furthermore, if any more documents are needed they will get in touch with me. 

- Around XX/XX/2018 I called Capital One regarding the status of the chargeback and I was told that it is in process and that it is going to take 90 days from XX/XX/2018, which will be around XX/XX/2018. 

- Moreover, I was assured that my documents were complete and that the chargeback will be refunded in my statement. 

- I would like to highlight that I have never missed a payment and in fact have always paid off the outstanding in few days of credit as a bonafide customer. 

- Around XX/XX/2018 my credit line was increased by {$500.00}. 

- On XX/XX/2018 after waiting for all the 90 days to pass I called up Capital One again. 

- After more than 1 hour of back and forth and deliberation in the dispute department with their representative XXXX I was told that my chargeback has been rejected due to lack of evidence. 

- I asked him if that was the case- why was I not notified by letter or email. To which XXXX responded "" I don't know ''. 

- I further inquired as to why upon my inquiry I am told about this refund rejection and that I was not told about the same when I submitted my correspondence documents with the merchant. 

- XXXX responded that he doesn't know about that too and that I have to resolve this directly with the merchant XXXX - I asked him to put me through their Supervisor and after 30 minutes further deliberation I was put through to a female named XXXX. 

- Upon my inquiry she further told me that she has no idea of why I was not sent the documents of rejection or a letter stating the same. 

- She said she will study my case and call me back within 24-72 hours.

- Todate it is over 5 days and nobody has contacted me from Capital One and I have received no correspondence regarding my chargeback. 

- Instead I received a new card of pre-approved offer. Do you want to rip me off again? Just because I am a good customer and that I always paid on time. Do you want to trap me further. I need an explanation for this. Why you could not address my cast while sending me this offer.

Original copies of all three Employment Certification Forms from three separate school districts were sent to XXXX via USPS Priority Mail. Copies of each were taken and maintained along with Priority Mail receipt. 


All three letters from XXXX denied PSLF qualification. The first denial was based on "" certified employment dates listed on ( your ) ECF were prior to the date ( you ) received ( your ) Direct Loans that would be eligible for PSLF. '' The second denial was based on "" Your employer did not provide the begin date of your employment in Section 3. The authorized official at your employer should contact us within 90 days of the date of this letter to provide us with this information so we can process your request. If you want us to consider your request after the 90 days, complete and submit new ECF and make sure to complete all of the required fields. '' This is FALSE and is an INTENTIONAL ERROR on the part of XXXX as BOTH the original and copy of the Employment Certification Form have the begin date in Section 3. 

The third denial was based on "" The authorized official at your employer did not provide the date they signed the form in Section 4. Complete and return the enclosed form. Don't forget to have your employe sign and date the form in Section 4. "" This is FALSE and is an INTENTIONAL ERROR on the part of XXXX as BOTH the original and copy of the Employment Certification Form have the date the employer signed the form in Section 4.

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX I called into customer service at Bank of the West in inquire why my account was showing - {$27.00} on my mobile app. 

The associate advised me that I was not overdrawn and had {$10.00} in my account. I asked if she could reverse 1 overdraft fee as a courtesy and she explained that she could not because I have had 1 fee reversed in the last 12 months. 
I asked the associate to cancel my overdraft protection so this is no longer an issue and they said they would. 

I expressed great concern that I would be charged overdraft fees so again I asked if my account was overdrawn. She immediately replied that is was not and asked me if I wanted to speak with the online dept. to learn how to read my mobile app. As insulted as I was I explained that no further assistance would be needed and the call was disconnected. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( next day ) I was assessed {$140.00} in overdraft fees and again on XX/XX/XXXX another {$35.00}. Assuming this was an error that would be cleared up by Monday I let it go. 

Monday XX/XX/XXXX I called into customer service again to express my concern and requested to speak with a manager. A manager named XXXX came to the line and heard my complaint. She stated that there were no notes from the associate I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX and that she would have to listen to the call. I advised that I would hold while she did so however she then stated that her manager had to review the call. I asked to speak with this manager but was told that they were not available and would call back. I have been told this in the past with no follow up so I feel it is necessary to being this to the CFPBs attention."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",XXXX XXXX applied a {$20.00} credit to my account XX/XX/2016. I didn't have a bill anymore from them so I call and they assured me the credit is there and when I close the account they would give it back to me. After I closed the account I do a chat to make Sure they are sending it to the right address. They tell me they see the credit but it is their policy not to give me the money. I said there is a big mistake so they continue to harasss me thinking I'm just going to drop it and they can keep my money. The manager acknowledge he wasn't sure if it was legal or not but he still wasn't going to give it back. They previous representative said it was on Google pay but when I talked to them they said they have nothing to do with XXXX XXXXXXXX. Google stole my money and they deceived me into thinking I would get it back later so I wouldn't file a complaint with my credit card.

I, as well as my authorized representatives, have been negotiating with SPS. They are often put on hold by the SPS representative and nobody returns on the line an hour later. Two months later, I do not have a response from SPS. The last time I spoke with a representative on Tuesday, XX/XX/2018, she said that I did not include the date under my signature in a Hardship Letter that I had provided ( the letter was dated XX/XX/2018 ). Even though the top of the had the date, I printed out a copy and, included the current date under my name. The SPS representative said I would hear back in 24 to 48 hours. It has been a week now and I have not heard anything. 

SPS is putting me in a position that I may lose my property because the bankruptcy judge does not believe I am trying to resolve this issue with SPS. I will have to escalate this action to a legal one."
Checking or savings account,"I had a parent/child checking and saving account with Bank of America with my son. On approximately XX/XX/2018 funds were transferred between the checking and savings account and withdrawn via Bitcoin and ATM. There was also a deposit ( {$300.00} ) via check. None of these transactions were done by my son or myself. The next day after discovering these transactions, I called the bank and was told there was nothing they could do until the transactions were out of the "" processing '' status. Once they cleared this status I called back and filed a fraud claim. My son made a police report and I continued to follow-up with the bank. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have gotten very little satisfaction with Bank of America from handling this claim, closing the account 9and my sin being XXXX listed with all banks ) to receiving his remaining funds in his account after it was closed. I have contacted the bank serval times from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX to clarify this issue. In XX/XX/XXXX I submitted all the required documents they have asked for and haven't gotten a written statement as to why the claim has been denied as of today. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was asked to submit a detailed copy of my cell phone bill to include all phone calls and text sent on the day in question to verify if authorization was given to make the bank transfers. I submitted the entire month of that bill and never received a response from Bank of America. I called about 3 days after submitting the phone bill and was told the information wasn't attached to my claim because I didn't call to tell them I submitted it ( although Bank of America gave me the information of where to submit the bill ). I then called back about 10 days later and was told the claim is still being investigated and can take up to 45 days. I called back about 2 weeks later and they concluded with a denial still ( still haven't received any written information  as to why the claim was denied ). While speaking with a representative ( XXXX or XXXX ) he couldn't understand why the claim was still denied and was attempting to put me in contact with the investigator that processed my claim and get a better understanding of why my claim was denied, we were mysteriously disconnected and he never called me back. I called back the following day and spoke with another representative and he said he would send a message for the previous ( XXXX or XXXX ) representative to contact me. Needless to say, neither the claims investigator or XXXX/XXXX has contacted me. I haven't contacted them since my last conversation in XXXX. I was told to submit a claim about this issue ( as per another bank ). 

Attached is a copy of exactly what I sent to Bank of America."

Checking or savings account,"I have been a loyal customer of Bank of America for over 10 years, in that period that bank of would grant its customer 24 hours to correct the mistake of a overdrawn balance.

Mortgage,"Dear BCFP, This complaint is in regards to the recently transferred investor of my loan, Freedom Mortgage Company which holds my FHA loan that was opened originally with LoanCare on XX/XX/XXXX. The following events have severly impacted my finances, lifestlye and credit score and taking away my ability to refinance with an ethical and legitimate lender that operates within the federal laws of the US. Freedom mortgage has completely failed to provide timely and understandable information that is imperative to making responsible decisions regarding my finances and busines ' especially when I have never been late on my mortgage payment in 6 years with another investor. 

XX/XX/XXXX is when the issues began. I made a mortgage payment of {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. However my bank account was charged again on XX/XX/XXXX for another {$1000.00}. The second charge on XX/XX/XXXX was returned to my bank minus transaction fees but the one taken out on XX/XX/XXXX, was not. 

I recieved a letter in the mail via USPS from FMC issuing a confirmaition # for the payment on XX/XX/XXXX of the full XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive any other contacts or notifications from Freedom mortgage company until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a phone call from FMC stating that they have not received XX/XX/XXXX payment, that they had reported me to the credit bureaus as being 30 days late and in default on my mortgage, which come to find out had resulted in a credit score decrease of over 100 points. I have contacted Freedom mortgage company nine separate times via phone and email, as well as recorded every conversation to make sure that I had all the information at hand when needed. I sent over 5 different responses to their request for documents showing this payment history and events in my bank account. Freedom mortgage company refuses to provide me any explanation and/or proof that they did or did not recieve any payment for XX/XX/XXXX in which case, where I see it, they already have an extra payment that should be XX/XX/XXXX full mortgage payment. So technically my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX. 


My several phone calls to Freedom mortgage customer service departments has resulted in no progress or information regarding the incorrect credit reporting and incorrect status placed on my mortgage. 


I was told by customer service there was a ticket created rectifying the payment issues of XX/XX/XXXX and they set a completion due date of XX/XX/XXXX and then pushed it back to XX/XX/XXXX. FMC did not contact me on XX/XX/XXXX or make any attempts, which they openly admited. Today, XX/XX/XXXX FMC informed me the ticket/work order on my account was actually closed on XX/XX/XXXX, with no notification to me whatsoever. They also informed me that the payment I made in XX/XX/XXXX that was applied to XX/XX/XXXX payment had been received however the payment that was taken out on XX/XX/XXXX still has not been returned, collected, or applied to my mortgage account. In which case, our XX/XX/XXXX payment has not been made yet because as of XX/XX/XXXX, we have now paid Freedom Mortgage {$2100.00} and only {$1100.00} has been applied to our account. I'm hoping you can help me resolve this if not I am covering my bases by making another mortgage payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX for the full {$1100.00} plus any fees they decide to attach which by the way they are holding a portion of the payment I made on XX/XX/XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX payment just in case we don't make XX/XX/XXXX payment. To me, this is extortion and I won't stand for it. My next step will be seeking legal counsel if this issue can't be resolved."
Student loan,"Navient calls me between 5-10 times a day regarding late student loan payments. When requesting forbarrence I was told there was a large fee for this than the amount currently owned. I feel I was steered away from help and forced to pay when I can not afford to pay at this time. I was out of work laid off for 7 months and still getting back on my feet. When I told navient this they told me the co signer needs to pay. The reps and managers are extremely rude, condescending and disrespectful. They do not try to help but force payment."

After the collection agency deleted the account several times Experian will not delete XXXX XXXX XXXX from my credit report. Inquiries are popping up on my credit report and i don’t understand why and who is doing it.

If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.

Now the insight of Chase bank i have accessed the forum to request the bank communicate if i am insufficient in allowing a payment i stopped to be paid and itemizing what Chase bank is going to pay. That i may request in depository rules other than FDIC my income that as a Insurance company can go to limit per day.

Consumer has 2 weeks to make a deposit before it can be returned. Chase bank informed the loan company XX/XX/XXXX that customer did not get a deposit and payment was returned insufficient. This is a violation of consumer privacy laws. Well. At that time Customer had no overdraft protection XX/XX/XXXX as a Chase bank asserted task but in XX/XX/XXXX Customer without giving Chase bank consent retains Overdraft protection. 
I am only 1 person. for all this excise activity. Y Further XX/XX/XXXX a stop payment paid from customer account. Your employees maybe FDIC especially when they think they are consumers rights.

In oversight of Chase bank revoking customers right in that the Fee {$25.00} XXXX when they allowed payment to post and pend payment that is a stop payment and add overdraft protection to the bills for that month to be paid. They do not make Financial decsions for customer and have and i herein in this complaint a request in notice :.

Further a request has been applied to the bank over the phone, then online message If Chase is going to enforce and disturb my rights in a stop payment fee of {$25.00} and to allow payment of the stop payment to clear I am not insufficient then The bank is in revocation of my right and to assert to notify me is harassment. How its my money that paid for it and as a request you should use your platform with online message available to notify or imply to customer of her overdraft in the account of insufficient but Chase paid and how i can make a deposit. Well i will make my deposit and apply the regulations to settle i notify you in this way as a civil request being defeated It would be advised the employees task a class of behavioral management in confusing their position to customers rights But since they are in custody and control of my right i believe we have a few regulated problems in request and my own personal input on screen of non overdraft protected. Chase bank says they can revoke may right and decide who they pay out of my account I have a lot of activity they state at another time is not visible but at that time was and lucky i learnt how to copy and paste, hold and keep documents before the task of it disappeared or is no loner available.

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that XXXX XXXX was transferring my loan to Specialized Loan Servicing on  XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a payoff from my second mortgage XXXX XXXX whom required a wire transfer to pay off my second loan. On XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX I wire transferred {$450.00} to XXXX XXXX 's account number. The XXXX XXXX clerk listed XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the beneficiary. The tracking number was XXXX. The wire transferred was delivered. XXXX XXXX inadvertently accepted the wire transfer from XXXX XXXX and applied the payment to my mortgage. It is unknown how the payment was applied as neither XXXX XXXX or SLS have provided a payment history. On XX/XX/XXXX my loan was transferred to SLS. The {$450.00}, according to XXXX XXXX was transferred to SLS. SLS has claimed that they had the funds but were not applied to my XX/XX/XXXX payment. According to SLS an investigation regarding the wire transfer was opened. On XX/XX/XXXX, in a phone conversation, I paid the remaining {$780.00} to make my loan current for the month of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a certified letter to SLS regarding the wire transfer and discrepancy in how it was applied to my loan. The letter was to arrive on XX/XX/XXXX. The same day I mailed a check for my XX/XX/XXXX payment in full to a separate XXXX XXXX for SLS ( certified receipt XXXX, confirmed delivery ). The payment was received and SLS rather than depositing my check withdrew the money from my account as an ACH payment. The money was withdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX from my XXXX XXXX   XXXX account ( check number XXXX ) I did not and have not authorized any ACH payments with SLS. I received an email confirmation that the payment was received. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted SLS again to resolve the status of my loan and address my letter. SLS then told me that my {$450.00} was applied to my XXXX payment ( as an autopost ), but now my {$780.00} payment had been applied to my principal as it was a partial payment ( as a curtailment ). I informed XXXX that the representative never informed me that my payment would be applied to my principal but that we had an in-depth conversation regarding that this payment would make my monthly payment current. I was never requested on informed XXXX XXXX or SLS that I wanted to make an additional payment toward my loan at any point in time. According to my financial records, my XXXX payment should be current and my XXXX payment was paid by check. According to SLS 's online history of my account the XXXX payment in the amount of {$1200.00} has NOT been credited or received by SLS. All payments have been made to both XXXX XXXX and SLS and my account is current. It is my belief that SLS is attempting to foreclose on my home and committing fraudulent acts with criminal intent."

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Illinois, for the total amount of {$2200.00} purchased through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Phone # XXXX. I was told by XXXX  that I would have 18 months to pay this off interest free. After 18 months, I would begin to pay interest on the amount unpaid. I agreed to this. I paid {$77.00} per month for 18 months and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement where XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX added an interest charge of {$340.00} for the 18 months previously. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and disputed the charge. I talked to XXXX from the Executive Office at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and was given the name of the Executive that would be helping me find a resolution to this charge. His name is XXXX XXXX I was given a Case # XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo to check the status of my case. I talked to XXXX. He stated that he would be sending an email out to XXXX. Still no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo again and spoke to XXXX. XXXX   states that they can not help me because I agreed to the terms. My argument was, that I did not agree to pay on interest that was deferred for 18 months, and that I had agreed to pay the interest after the 18 months.

I feel that I was incorrectly informed regarding how the interest rate worked and can not agree with their resolution of writing off the interest and paying the remaining balance of {$1100.00}. I could not afford the XXXX XXXX then and I can not afford to pay the balance in full. That is why I agreed to pay in monthly installments.

Anything that you can do to help me financially would be appreciated.

Thank you for your time."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The reason for my writing this letter is to inform you that this bureau is being unreasonable. I am a victim of identity theft, my information was compromised and fraudulent inquiries were included in my report without my consent or authorization. 
As a result, I contacted this company with a detail explanation that I am a victim of identity theft on XX/XX/XXXX. I pointed out in detail to them, of all the inquiries that I did not authorize and were fraudulent.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am attempting to get a mortgage approval to buy a home. 2 of 3 credit agencies allowed my credit reports to be pulled by the finance company. Equifax however did not allow my credit report to be pulled because it was locked. 

I called Equifax 's XXXX number three times this morning. Their automated system makes it impossible to speak with someone to fix this. 

I then obtained a secondary Customer Service number of XXXX XXXX. I called it this afternoon and a woman that barely speaks English asked me multiple questions about past mortgages, past loans, addresses, date of birth etc. and said that I was authenticated. She then determined that my current address that I have been living at for over a year and a half was not updated. She refused to update it on the call despite having already authenticated me. 

A third-party company that has incorrect information about me should not prevent me from buying a house. THIS IS RIDICULOUS!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",A credit repair firm sent multiple dispute letters addressing a MOHELA account on my XXXX  report. This account is listed with a {$0.00} balance but is still being reported as an active late payment account.
Checking or savings account,"As shown on the attached scan, BB & T has opened Banking Accounts ( checking I believe, and an e-Savings account ) and a credit card which I did not request. It appears they were opened on XXXX XX/XX/2018."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2018, XXXX XXXX XXXX deposited two checks in the amounts of {$670000.00} and {$82000.00} in the incorrect account at JP Morgan Chase located at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NJ. The checks were made payable to XXXX XXXX XXXX Living XXXX. One came from an attorney trust account and the other from an escrow settlement account from a title company. The checks should have been have been deposited in XXXX XXXX trust account with XXXX XXXX. 

The teller accepted the checks and deposited them in the JP Morgan Chase account. ( See attachments. ) A letter dated XX/XX/2018, and received nearly a week later from JP Morgan Chase indicated that the account was blocked and will be closed ( see letter attached. ) In addition to not enabling XXXX XXXX to have access to the 2 checks that were erroneously deposited, JP Morgan Chase also pulled from the account and disabled access to {$33000.00}. Due to this action by the bank, two checks written against the account bounced. 

XXXX XXXX went to the bank and the manager of the branch contacted the home office and was told that we should open a trust account at JP Morgan or to contact the people who wrote the checks and have the checks recalled. 

XXXX XXXX contacted the bank ( see letter attached ) to ask that the funds be forwarded/transferred to them since the trust account where they should be deposited was held with them. JP Morgan Chase refused to do so and reiterated that XXXX would need to open a trust account with JP Morgan Chase. 

XXXX XXXX went back and forth with JP Morgan Chase numerous times. As of Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX JP Morgan Chase indicated that they mailed back to XXXX a check for {$33000.00}, though that has not yet been received as of today, Friday, XX/XX/2018. At the same time, XXXX XXXX was forced to open up another trust account with incurred attorney fees in the amount of {$300.00} in order to get access to the two checks deposited in error. JP Morgan is transferring the amounts of the two checks -  {$670000.00} and {$82000.00} and allege that the money will be in the account by next Wednesday, XX/XX/2018. Additionally, the money will lose significant interest in JP Morgan as opposed to where it should be residing at XXXX XXXX and, when asked, the branch manager for JP Morgan in XXXX, NJ indicated that she did not know if or when well be able to pull the money out to put back into the account it should be in at XXXX XXXX."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I am deeply disappointed with Bank Of America and XXXX XXXX for ending financial services to law abiding companies making and selling Firearms. This is nothing but an attempt at social engineering and bullying by large institutions who benefited from taxpayer funded bailouts when they faced financial collapse due to their questionable practices.

The entities they have targeted are operating legally and protected by our second amendment. My wife and I are both Life Members of the NRA, and strong supporters of our second amendment. We would like to see these financial institutions honor the taxpayers who saved them by supporting our second amendment rather than bowing to political pressures from the left."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2018, I received a letter from the credit bureau stating that a collection account from Merchants Credit Guide Co. was added to my credit report for {$78.00}. A collection that I didn't know anything about. I never received a bill, letter, warning etc.. from the collector 's office. I called the collection agency, verbal information was given to me. I requested a written copy of bill in dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX of 2018 I received such written information. I went through my records to find out this bill to XXXX XXXX XXXX was paid with check # XXXX on XX/XX/2018 for the amount of {$86.00}. ( XXXX + XXXX. ) I called XXXX  talked to XXXX and she told me there was no record of me paying this bill and did not find a copy of the check in dispute. I am submitting evidence from my bank account that check was cashed on XXXX. They deposited this check electronically didn't cash it through the regular channels. This dispute destroyed my credit record falling down XXXX points according to the credit bureau."
Student loan,"In XXXX, I took out a student loan to attend XXXX  school at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXa at XXXX XXXX. I borrowed approximately {$22000.00}. I began paying back on the loan in XXXX. Since that time the loan has been bought and sold numerous times. I can not tell you what specific lending institutions had the loan during the past 19 years. Currently, my balance is over {$17000.00} after paying on it for nearly 20 years. I dont know how that could possibly be. I have tried on multiple occasions to contact lenders for loan and payments histories to no avail. No one has been able to provide this information. Specifically, I have not been able to find the original amount borrowed versus what I have paid to date. I have had no success tracking this down. The current loan holder is Navient. They have not been able to provide any relevant information either. I am reaching out to you to help me resolve this matter. I have had zero luck myself. I feel I am throwing money down the drain."
Vehicle loan or lease,On XX/XX/2018 I traded my XXXX XXXX for a XXXX   ally banked reported the payment 30 days late. With the payout being processed and I received a check for over payment
Checking or savings account,"I responded to an offer to open a checking account at HSBC. The opening process was excruciating but I worked through it. I made two transfers of funds and was disappointed both times by an extremely long transfer time. Everything about HSBC is slow and clunky. I attempted to close the account on XX/XX/2018 by contacting customer support. I was advised that there would be a fee for closing the account before six months through a rep but if I were to transfer my balance out first there would be no fee. This advice was given by phone and I have a recording of that conversation. When that transfer was complete on XX/XX/2018, I called back to close the account and that rep refused to close the account because there were insufficient funds to cover their fee. I was told that I would have to transfer {$25.00} back in. I have a recording of that conversation. All transfers were initiated via the HSBC web service, this transfer took a full week. When the funds finally showed up on XX/XX/2018, I called back and closed the account. That rep again attempted to convince me to keep the account open. I firmly told her to just close the account. I was told that the account was closed. I have a recording of that conversation. I logged back in on the XXXX to make sure and not only was it not closed but they have assessed a "" {$25.00} minimum balance fee. '' HSBC 's purpose here seems to be to keep the account open by refusing to close it for the express purpose of assessing exorbitant fees. I believe that this constitutes FRAUD."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on XX/XX/2018, I am not sure how this happened, I believe I made my payments to you on time when I received my statements, My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
Mortgage,"Hi, I am part of the hundreds of customers that were denied a home loan modification by Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX when experienced financial distress due to employer furloughs and other financial reasons. I sent loan modification packages to Wells Fargo for 2 years and then, due to the loan modification denials, I was forced to short sale my home. 
Since a few months ago I have been in contact with Wells Fargo and they say that their "" computer glitch '' did not affect their calculations and that my case is not elegible for financial compensation. 
I believe they are wrong and that my case needs to be investigated by an independent."
Mortgage,"I was on a disaster forbearance through the end of XX/XX/2018, for the Thomas Fires in XX/XX/2018. The servicer had a scheduled sale date of XX/XX/18, I called & reminded them I was under disaster forbearance protection & they moved the sale date to XX/XX/18. On XX/XX/18 the president declared my area a disaster area once again, for the Woosley Fires. I immediately contacted Seterus &  advised them that I needed to apply for another disaster forbearance for the current fire disaster. I was told that the request was submitted & that the sale date would be postponed. I was following up w seterus on XX/XX/18, when I found out that the sale date was not pushed & there was no record of my disaster forbearance request. I was told that I would need to submit a Mortgage Assistance Application to be reviewed for the disaster forbearance. I was previously told that under in a disaster situation, the request could be submitted over the phone in order to expedite-however, now I needed to submit the application. I did so on the same day. I am worried that there will not be enough time to postpone the sale & review for disaster forbearance."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Im a regular customer of WesternUnion. On XX/XX/2018 I sent two separate transactions overseas. The reasons I did two transactions was the auto fill from previous transactions. 

I sent {$70.00} and then {$30.00} to the same person. However, WesternUnion cancelled the transaction for the {$70.00} and the {$30.00} available.

I wasnt notified by WesternUnion that they canceled the transaction. I didnt know whats going until the receiver went to WesternUnion XX/XX/XXXX after going for consecutive days. WesternUnion overseas told I took the money back. On XX/XX/2018 I called WesternUnion and was told by two different representatives that they cant access the transfer, but I should call back in 15-20 minutes two times. Finally, I was told that they canceled my transaction because I sent separate transactions. Nobody seems to know whats the real problem. I called back WesternUnion representative again and asked if I send another transaction on XX/XX/XXXX if the person would be able to get the money. I was reassured by the representative yes. I was taken aback when WesternUnion again canceled-suspended the transaction again. I had to asked for a refund. 
After numerous calls I called back XX/XX/XXXX and asked for the department that placed restrictions on my transactions and was give this email XXXX for help. I sent an email and I havent received an email or phone call from WesternUnion about this inconvenience. I must say this situation was handled unprofessional and without regards or thoughtfulness of all party involved. Im very disappointed with WesternUnion."
Vehicle loan or lease,"Good Afternoon, My name is XXXX XXXX, I am writing this complaint against chase Auto Financing for my car loan. I bought XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I have the loan for 72 payments. I have done some skip payments that were added to the end of my loan. I also have been late with payments through out my loan time. On XX/XX/XXXX ( some where around that time ) I wanted to go and trade my car in. As the car dealer called to get the pay off figure with chase Auto. The pay off Figure at that time was XXXX. I was a little confuse as to why it was still so high. But, anyway could not trade the car in because of credit and the amount I still own on the car. So on Monday XX/XX/XXXX I decided to call Chase Auto to make a payment on my account and I also asked how many payments did I still have on the existing loan. The lady from chase told me that I owed 9 payments. so I was like ok. I took my car payment amount of XXXX x XXXX = XXXX. So I was Like ok can you tell me what my Pay off amount is. She told me that my pay off amount was XXXX. So then I question her as to why my pay off was so high when my payment left on the car was XXXX. She told me that I had 3 skip payments that were added to the end of the loan. I said ok So I took my XXXX x XXXX which would include the 3 skip payments. this came out to the amount of XXXX so I said that makes a difference of XXXX, XXXX that is in question. She proceeded to tell me because I was late with payments over 20 times and late fees and what not. I told her that is insane and that I did not agree with this. wanted to speak to manager and she said that they were all busy. So I hung up and then I called back and spoke with a gentleman. He proceeded to tell me that the XXXX was all interest that I owed because I was late. I was like how. everytime I was late I paid the late fee with my payment. so I was a little frustrated and was XXXX and getting angry and loud with the gentleman. he was like I can give you a copy of your payment history. I said I do not understand if I was late and then made the late fee payment why that did not include the interest. he said no it dose not so my late fee amount were like XXXX so I said what don't make scense to me is that I have had this car for 6 and 1/2 years and I still owe a lot on this car and I can't get out of the loan because I owe too much to trade it. so I said well my car payment was XXXX a month I have always paid XXXX to round it up and know your saying I still owe XXXX on top of my payment owed. I do not even understand. he proceeded to tell me that there late fee amount is XXXX per day until I make the payment. I told him that was rip off and that I never was told that and. he told me its in my contract and that there is nothing I can do but to pay off the car. so when I said that the company is horriable and they don't work you and all this XXXX he said we do work with you because I made 62 payments on a XXXX2 payment loan. so now its 10 more payments and yet that is not how it come out to me. so this just frustrated me even more. so I got off the phone with him and then thought about it and thought about that I called again for the 3 time in one day and spoke to a ladey that I did not get attitude with but just for them to email or fax me a copy of my payment history. So she took my information and I proceeded to wait. So at the end of the day I did not get a fax. So on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I called again about where my fax was. They proceeded that my request was mailed out instead of fax. So I was XXXX on that part again. so I asked if they could do a fax to me as a rush that I wanted to resolve this matter on my interest.

Student loan,"i made an electronic payment around XX/XX/XXXX, over 6 weeks ago, of about {$110.00} That payment was removed from my bank account and sent to Navient. I quickly noticed that the payment was never applied to my Navient account, so I started calling my bank and Navient to determine what was going on. After a group phone call between me, a representative from my bank, and a Navient representative it was determined that Navient had misplaced my payment, but my payment was sent to the right address. The representative then stated that the issue should definitely be resolved by my next due date at the latest. I then proceeded to call at a minimum once a week to keep tabs on the progress, and each week I was told something different by each representative, with none of them having any idea about my accounts situation whatsoever. Every representative after the initial one told me that my payment was sent to the wrong address and it would be relocated within the week, and they highly suggested that I use my forbearance until the issue is resolved. One representative even told me that she had expedited my request and that someone had to look at it the next day and that it would be addressed that weekend. I also reached out via email and 5 days after the original email I received a response that was completely useless and in no way answered my original question. My next loan payment was due last week, and I made the payment on time directly through Navient this time, but noticed that the first original payment still had not been applied to my account as promised by Navient. I also tried calling during their normal business hours and was given a runaround by their automated phone system three times."

I originally submitted the dispute on XX/XX/18, then again with more information on XX/XX/18 and again on XX/XX/18. The charge was disputed as I had returned the purchased merchandise but not received a credit from the merchant. I provided all the relevant information including my call log with the merchant and original billing statement. Chase either neglected to acknowledge the dispute or the acknowledgment sent did not have any information identifying this charge. The same is true for Chase 's written request for further information. 
Despite not providing any information identifying the charge in either the acknowledgment of dispute or request for further information on XX/XX/18 Chase sent a letter stating I had failed to provide information on the dispute.

Student loan,"I initially submitted a formal complaint against Navient in regards to a student loan my wife co-signed for. I made a 1 time payment to Navient to have my wifes name taken off the cosigning of the loan. Navient failed to send a XXXX form to me to submit to the IRS explaining that the loan is not in default or settled. My daughter is still paying on her loan. Because Navient failed to send me XXXX form to submit to the IRS my federal income tax returns have been with held from me for the past 3 years. I have been trying to explain this mistake Navient made to them and I am getting nowhere. On top of that issue, since Navient reported to the IRS that I earned {$24000.00} dollars extra in XX/XX/2016, the IRS is now coming after me for unclaimed income in which is not the case. Navient has not been helpful at all, in fact they are quite rude on the telephone if you can ever get off of being on hold. My first complaint number was XXXX, I just received a notice from CFPD that Navient can not address the issue because of a "" unauthorized third party '', I am not sure what that means.

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX regarding an alleged debt from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' in the amount of {$90.00} from dates of service : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. These two {$45.00} charges were disputed by me almost two years ago with the hospital due to the fact the doctors office wanted me to pay for an office visit to receive lab results. Upon hearing that XXXX XXXX decided to take their concerns to a debt collector almost two years later, I called Wakefield & Associates on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX. During the phone call, I was informed that the debt owed was in fact not {$90.00} as listed in their letter, but rather {$110.00}. XXXX downplayed the other charges as "" miscellenous '' but could not ( and would not ) provide any additional information about these charges. He did, however, mention that they were for dates of service XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. While the charge in XXXX may be apart of the date of service on XX/XX/XXXX. I have been a resident of XXXX, TN and not visited XXXX XXXX  or XXXX, TN since leaving the city in XX/XX/XXXX so I am not sure how I could have been responsible for the alleged charge in XXXX of this year. After asking for more information about these charges, XXXX told me that there wasn't more that he could provide me, but that I would have to dispute the charges. He then began asking if I worked and where I worked. I told him that this was not relevant and not something he should be able to ask me. He became defensive and asked "" why not '' and "" what law are you taking about ''. He continued badgering me for information by asking if it was a "" state or federal law. '' When I offered to look up the laws regarding contacting any other persons besides myself ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692b ) and engaging in abusive behavior ( FDCPA 15 U.S.C. 1692d ) he shut down and said that "" we've already been on the phone for over ten minutes now. '' I told him that this conversation was also being recording and that I would be filing a complaint because of the tone and content of his questions. I have attached the recording of the phone conversation, as well as a photo copy of the letter sent to me for review."
Debt collection,"I received a call at work from this collection agency claiming to be attempting to collect a student loan debt about a month ago. I immediately told the representative not to contact me at work and that the amount alleged owed was in dispute. I further requested verification from them in writing of the alleged debt. This was about a month ago. Despite me telling them not to contact me at work they have continued to do so twice, including today ( XX/XX/2018 ) from someone who identified himself as XXXX at approximately XXXX. Central time. In addition when speaking to the receptionist at my work the representatives have given the name of the company as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which anyone can XXXX  and see it a debt collection agency. Perhaps the most egregious thing this agency has done was to send a letter to a general fax number stating that they were requesting employment verification for me. They included my social security number and ask about my income. This letter was left on a general fax machine where anyone could have and did see both my social security number, the agency and their request about my income. This fax was sent at XXXX. central time so the company should have reasonably known that sending a fax with that personal information likely would not have been retrieved until the next morning meaning anyone, including random office cleaning staff would have had access to my social security number. Furthermore I still have not received the verification I requested. I believe that all of these actions are in violation of federal law and was done solely to repeatedly harass me."

I immediately went to the bank the next day to inquire. The bank stated this was some sort of correction and stated he could not say what it was. I then contacted the resolution department and they started an investigation per XXXX. The bank then stated that I was given {$5000.00} not {$3000.00}. This is not correct. I was only given {$3000.00}. Why would the bank give me nearly {$2000.00} more than was available in my account? I only received {$3000.00} and that is all I signed for. I have been waiting for a return call from the branch manager for 5 days.

Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX, Loancare LLC withdrew my mortgage 3 times, {$2600.00} the first 2 times, and {$2400.00} the third time. This issue was eventually resolved but had a ripple effect across the rest of my bills, as I am currently not able to afford 3 mortgage payments. Over the course of the next year, Loancare would not withdraw the funds on or about the desired date, in some cases waiting until past the due date, in which case they would turn off auto pay, add a late fee and then contact us. In XX/XX/XXXX, we refinanced with them to lower the percentage rate. We had auto-pay set up from the get go, but in XXXX we were notified that they do not use auto-pay so the payments we not pulled. Furthermore, when looking into our Credit Report it came to light that Loancare kept our original mortgage on file, so when we called we were told we had two payments per month to make. We made XXXX and XXXX 's payment, but in XXXX when I called to transfer my payment I was told they would not accept any further payment unless I catch up in full for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. My bank, XXXX, is tracking ACH transactions in XXXX and XXXX which withdrew the payments, as well as multiple additional attempts to pull money each month. When I addressed the issue with Loancare, they told me they had no records of the XXXX/XXXX   payments and I needed to contact XXXX, which I did promptly, leading to a conference call between myself and the two companies. Despite XXXX explaining that they had proof that Loancare had already pulled the payments for XXXX and XXXX, Loancare is insisting that they never received the payments and I must catch up in full. This is causing me to take a Loan out on my Thrift Savings Plan to catch up with the hope that they do not lose this as well."

Checking or savings account,"I signed up for a joint checking and savings account on XX/XX/2018. The offer at the time was for a {$400.00} bonus if I kept {$15000.00} combined in the accounts for 60 days, and the bonus would be credited to me within 90 days of time interval completion. This means the latest date the bonus should have been credited was XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, no bonus has been credited. I have contacted Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the issue and I was promised that the bonus would be credited by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Citi again because the bonus was still not credited. A case was opened on my behalf and I was assured that I would have a response within 2 business days. I received no communication from the bank regarding this issue in those days. I contacted Citi again on XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that the case was received and established that I was eligible for the bonus, and that the bonus would be credited to me within 3 business days. 3 business days have since passed, and no bonus is pending or posted to my account. I feel I have been very patient with this issue and I am extremely dissatisfied with Citibank regarding the process."

I refuse to provide my personal information to anyone at any time in this environment. When I am asked for the last four of my SSN, I kindly say, "" No. '' She says to me that she will call me back. She does not ask me if this is an okay number to call. 

Since I share my office with a co-worker and there are often XXXX in my work area, the telephone call to my work makes for a very uncomfortable and unsafe situation. 

I called ( XXXX ) XXXX, the California Check Cashing and spoke with XXXX and explained my non-private situation to her and told her that the staff at California Check Cashing are making this debt collection very, very uncomfortable and very unsafe for me when they call my work number.

I am NOT in a place to disclose my personal information or my personal business. 
When I called, I shared with XXXX that since they are not willing to comply with my request, I will be filing a complaint. XXXX told me to do what I have to do and they will not stop the calls to my work until I make a payment. 
I informed XXXX that in the XXXX environment it is considered contraband for me to bring in a cell phone, so I am unable to pick up calls from my cell phone during my work hours. After work, I am on a 1.5-2 hour commute. 

I asked XXXX for the manager 's ( XXXX ) last name so I could provide last names to add to my complaint ; XXXX refused to provide a last name and told me that she is unable to provide XXXX 's last name.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/18, I contacted Capital One Credit Card customer service to balance transfer {$25.00} from my bank account to increase my credit balance to hold my rental vehicle for an additional day. 

I was told my the customer service supervisor this feature was not available on my type of credit card which is quantified as "" secured ''. I advised him this had been done before my simply by verifying funds available in my account. He stated this was done incorrectly, and was a Capital One decision not to offer this feature on "" secured '' cards. 

I advised I reviewed my T & C 's online and do not see this called out and if this was indeed a specific policy that impacted credit decisions for my card I needed this in writing. I was told this policy was unavailable. Any policy that impacts credits or funds transfer availability should be available to all consumers to ensure proper decision on credit card companies. 

When told I wanted to file a formal complaint as there is clear inconsistency in service options, I was told the supervisor would submit a complaint to the "" back office '' however they could not guarantee a return call. I told the supervisor this was unacceptable and I believed the information provided to be in violation of the FCRA. I asked to speak to the compliance department and was told Capital One did not have a compliance department. A large credit company under regulatory oversight without a compliance/audit department is clearly a falsehood. I do not appreciate being lied to by my credit provider."
Mortgage,"We need assistance with this short sale. We sent in the offer for the short sale on XX/XX/2018. The Buyer is a cash buyer who offered {$80000.00}. Please see the timeline below on the chain of events : XX/XX/2018 - Called SPS and spoke to XXXX. I was told that there was an exterior XXXX that was done ( a drive by ) and that according to the Investor, only a drive-by, exterior XXXX would only be done and they do not want to order an interior XXXX. I had the issue escalated to ask the Investor if we could get a variance on the exterior XXXX and request an interior XXXX. 

( Because of this information, we started working on a value dispute that thoroughly presented all issues that the property has that severely affect it's overall value and that would not be captured and acknowledged in a regular drive-by XXXX which only looks at the property at a comparable value ) XX/XX/2018 - Called XXXX and spoke to XXXX at the XXXX office. XXXX understood the issue in regards to exterior vs. interior XXXX and informed me that there was no update on my escalation request from XX/XX/XXXX, and to check back in the next several days. 

It took awhile to get the Value Dispute since the Agent had to take pictures, write a cover letter as well having a Contractor come out to the property and write up an estimate repair bid. We sent in this value dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/2018 - Called XXXX and spoke to XXXX. He stated that he was able to open a query and request an interior XXXX to be done. He told me to call back in 48 hours to make sure that the Interior XXXX was indeed ordered. 

XX/XX/2018 - Called XXXX and spoke to XXXX again. He stated that the Interior XXXX Request was approved. The Agent should be receiving a phonecall from a XXXX Agent. I immediately informed XXXX, the listing agent, that he should be getting a phonecall soon. 

XX/XX/2018 - Called XXXX and spoke to XXXX. XXXX nor I had gotten a phonecall at this point from a XXXX Agent trying to gain access to the property. She confirmed that the value was ordered on XX/XX/18 but did not see any notes on who the XXXX Agent was. I requested this information so we could just call the XXXX Agent directly instead of waiting around. 

XX/XX/2018 - Called XXXX and spoke to XXXX. She stated that the XXXX Agent 's contact info was still not available and that she could escalate this issue. I was told to call back in 48 hours. 

XX/XX/2018 - Called XXXX and spoke to XXXX. She was finally able to give me the XXXX Agent 's name and email address. 

I immediately called the XXXX Agent and left a message and sent him an email urging him to call us back ASAP because per XXXX, he needed to get the Interior XXXX done so we can move forward with the short sale. He contacted me back and stated that XXXX gave him a phone number that was neither mine 's nor XXXX 's number ( the listing agent ). I told him to contact XXXX immediately to get an interior XXXX scheduled. I emailed the XXXX Agent and cc 'd XXXX stating that we were finally able to connect and if both of them could update me on when the Interior XXXX would be scheduled. 

On XX/XX/2018 ; I got an email from XXXX stating that although he and the XXXX Agent had scheduled a time to do the interior XXXX, The XXXX Agent received a "" cancellation '' on the Interior valuation report. 

I immediately called XXXX and spoke to XXXX. I was then told that although they never approved the Interior XXXX and that the file had been declined out of the short sale review as of XX/XX/2018. This was the complete opposite of what I had been repeatedly told by multiple XXXX reps for an entire month. I re-escalated the file and asked her Supervisor to call me ASAP. I never received a phonecall from any XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2018 I emailed all our contacts we know from XXXX in regards to the issues on the file and that we needed assistance immediately. We also put in the first CFPB complaint on XX/XX/XXXX. I called several executives and left voicemails : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

After no response whatsoever, I called XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX. She stated there was no update on my escalation ( to re-request a variance ) and to call back. 

I called again on XX/XX/2018 and spoke to XXXX. He admitted that the interior valuation request came from him and that he inputted the wrong number on the system for the XXXX Agent to refer to when it was time to call the Valuation contact. He put in a 2nd order to get the Interior Valuation done. 

I called XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX. He stated that there was no update in regards to the Interior Value request and to call back. 

I called XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX again. No update XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter from XXXX stating that the Interior Valuation was being denied and that they had to proceed with the incomplete, drive-by value of $ XXXX. 

This will be the 2nd CFPB complaint about the same thing. Please advise that the house not only has foundational problems, water damage inside and outside the house as well as roof damage, but environment ones as well like proper disposal of toxic contaminants from used automobiles surrounding the house and used auto parts in the garage and mold in the basement. I am not even sure if the Underwriters read the entirety of this Value Dispute because these are serious issues that are on these properties. We are not talking about aesthetic repairs. I am re-attaching the value dispute once again. 

Please call me ASAP to discuss. We want to move forward with the Short Sale but we need to get an Interior Valuation ordered."

I haven't used my maiden name for at least 15 years and I had XXXX for 14 years. I haven't had XXXX XXXX XXXX for 20 years and didn't owe a balance and I've never had services with XXXX.

The account remains on my credit report."

I paid three payments of {$250.00} with one returned by my bank for NSF. They re-ran this ACH three subsequent times, causing further overdrafts.

XXXX is a tribal entity that bought this debt and onctheir behalf, the above collection agency is trying to collect {$1500.00}. I am disputing this allegation/claim because I have never done business with XXXX. Also, XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to verify the original debtor, XXXX, the original date of the debt and the amount. They listed it on my credit report as a debt originated in XX/XX/XXXX, which they are claiming as a new debt. Further, they are using an ACH withdrawal per XXXX ; to verify the debt as being owed to them. When I spoke to XXXX, he asked for my SSN, which I provided and said I did not recognize the loan originator and the dates. He then mentioned XXXX and pressured me to settle. I was unable to clarify to him that the debt originator and dates were incorrect. He was rude and told me I listened to you and now you will listen to me."

I tried calling U.S. Bank and Iget switched to wrong departments."
Student loan,Naviant has a web portal for viewing loans. This information does not include what portion of the loan goes towards interest and principle. There is no statement provided that give this information either. The lack of transparency traps users into never knowing how much is actually going against the principle balance and is deceptive.
Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that the title on my truck still had a lien against it since XX/XX/XXXX. I asked the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles for a number to call. The number they gave me was XXXX XXXX. XXXX told me they had no records or information on my vehicle. They then gave me the number for ALLY FINANCIAL XXXX. I called and spoke to XXXX ( no ID # available ) and explained that I needed a clear title to my car. She said she could mail one that I would receive in 3-5 days. I told her this was unacceptable because I was in financial need and needed my title asap. I requested the information be XXXX to me overnight. She said she would. The next day XX/XX/XXXX, I called to get the tracking number so I could check on the delivery time. I spoke with XXXX ( id # XXXX ) and went through the same explaination. She told me she was going to open a case, apparently there was no record of the call I made on XX/XX/XXXX, the case # is XXXX. She would then need to get approval from her supervisor then the title would be sent to me by XXXX and I would get the information in 24-48 hours. I called again the next day, XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to XXXX ( id # XXXX ). She was not able to help in any way and I asked to speak to her supervisor, who is XXXX ( id # XXXX ). It was after speaking to XXXX that I found out what the problem was, the Title Department at ALLY FINANCIAL, no longer had the title to my truck. The best that could be done was a I could be sent a release letter that I would then need to take to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles before I could get a clear title to my truck. She also informed me a release letter had been sent by US mail and I would receive it in 3-5 days. I have already told everyone I have spoken to that 3-5 days is unacceptable since my truck was paid off sometime in XX/XX/XXXX and that the title to my truck should have been clear for the last 14 years. Somebody somewhere made a mistake. XXXX told me she would call me on XX/XX/XXXX to give me the tracking number. I asked what time to expect the call. She then told the office would be open from XXXX EST to XXXX and because of the volume of incoming calls she couldn't give me a time to expect her call. I live in a CST State. So I am still in the same spot I was in 3 days ago. I have no other way to solve my financial difficulties, I am currently unemployed and trying to find a second job so I can take of myself. I wrote this complaint because I feel I have no other recourse. ALLY FINANCIAL must be a very corrupt organization. They are being held responsible for {$80.00} XXXX to be repaid to minorities for charging them higher interest rates on auto loans, in addition to an {$18.00} XXXX  fine. At this moment I don't know what will happen to me or whether or not I will get the information in a timely fashion."

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX. 
Wells Fargo I responded : I have no idea what you are referring to. I did not state I was traveling in XXXX. None of what you referred to was in the email I sent you. 
I received a wire transfer from the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in Yen. There was no ATM involved. There was no travel to XXXX. There was no purchase made. I was told by my branch manager in XXXX XXXXXXXX there would only be a {$15.00} wire transfer fee to receive money from the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
No other fees were mentioned. 

They responded by giving me a case # XXXX and saying they would look into it. And they would get back to me in 10 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX Called Foreign Currency Department XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX in XXXX XXXX. 
I spoke with XXXX XXXX about the rate of exchange. 
We spoke for over 30 minutes about how Wells Fargo deals with converting yen to dollars.

He told me various scenarios of how the bank puts the yen I received with other orders of yen to amass large amounts and then converts them.

I spent over 30 minutes asking XXXX XXXX what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to when deciding when during a day of, ( his words ), "" wildly fluctuating exchange rates, '' which they would use. Obviously, for me they used the largest Yen to dollar rate and I lost {$16000.00}. 
I questioned him to relate to me what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to about when and at what rate my yen gets converted. 
He told me that the amount of yen I received was small. I said I disagreed. 
XXXX XXXX said my amount transferred wasnt high enough to warrant a better rate. 
He said that day XX/XX/XXXX the rate fluctuated wildly from XXXX Yen per dollar to XXXX Yen per dollar. I obviously got the high Yen to Dollar rate to benefit Wells Fargo. 
He began to tell me when the amount in question was between {$100000.00} - {$500000.00}, that wasnt enough to warrant a better rate. 
I told him he was incorrect. He tried to repeat himself and then said he was wrong. The amount was close to {$800000.00} if the lowest yen to dollar amount was used for that day when the transfer was complete. 

I thanked XXXX XXXX for his help and said that I was unsatisfied with the explanation and with Wells Fargo Bank and wished I had never used them in this transaction. I said that my confidence in their treatment of my account was severely changed and that doing future business with them was impacted negatively. I added that I hoped a manager or boss of XXXX XXXX would review my complaint. 
He said they would. 
The whole conversation was recorded. 


XX/XX/XXXX Wrote a secure email to Wells Fargo saying that the difference between what $ were deposited in my account and the conversion rate for that day was over {$16000.00} I said I had lost faith in Wells Fargo to deal fairly and wanted answers. 

Here is the email : Reference # XXXX. I have not heard back from you concerning my wire transfer from the XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative who responded to my original email request for an explanation of the conversion of yen to U.S dollars gave atartlingly incorrect and lengthy explanation of traveling and purchasing items in XXXX and the fees involved. I have no faith in Wells Fargo to have handle my simple wire transfer ethically and with a mind to keeping my business. 
The rate of exchange for that day was XXXX yen to {$1.00}. XXXX Yen/ {$1.00} XXXX Yen = {$800000.00} On my Wells Fargo account the conversion is only for {$780000.00}. The difference is {$16000.00}. Wells Fargo charged me a huge amount of money for something. You either charged me for a purchase I did not make, a use of funds in a manner that did not happen, fees that were not disclosed to me or a far worse conversion rate of yen to dollars. 

I need a response.

Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX I Called the Federal Reserve to register a complaint about Wells Fargo Bank Spoke with XXXX # XXXX Went to online Wells Fargo Account and searched for terms and agreements-NO search results, told to go to link for our public website. 
I searched the website of Wells Fargo online for Account Terms and Agreements and got NO search results. There is nothing for me to have informed myself about how Wells Fargo receives a foreign currency or when or how it is converted into U.S. dollars. NO information on whether I need to be contacted with the rate that will apply NO asking me for permission to do so, NO rules that need to be complied with for Wells Fargo. 
I logged onto XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I understand your concerns regarding your recent incoming wire transfer. I am grateful that you brought this matter to our attention.

I logged onto XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 


I researched XX/XX/XXXX for the conversion rate on several sites. 
Web search indicates on XX/XX/XXXX an exchange rate of XXXX Yen/ {$1.00} XXXX Yen = {$800000.00} On my Wells Fargo account the conversion is only for {$780000.00}. 

That is a difference of {$16000.00} that I did NOT get because XXXX Yen per $! was used. 
XXXX Yen / {$1.00} XXXX Yen = XXXX I want to lodge a formal complaint starting with Wells Fargo Bank officials. 
I think they used the worst possible conversion rate on that day and somehow covered up the real transaction amount by compiling my funds with other funds, converting them for more U.S. dollars and then hiding the actual transfer in paperwork I am not privy to. The amount they gave me in my account was the worst possible rate fro that day and they profited on my Yen transfer because no one is keeping tabs on their movement of funds and conversions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed that I did not want to receive a phone call from the executive office but wanted a response in writing. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX,  I received a letter from Wells Fargo : Dated XX/XX/XXXX Case Reference XXXX Transaction Amount {$780000.00} Work of Date XX/XX/XXXX Our records show Wells Fargo received XXXX XXXX Yen at the current exchange rate of XXXX resulting in a credit to your account for {$780000.00}. For any further assistance please contact directly our Foreign Exchange Wire services at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

I searched the Wells Fargo Website on my online account for any information on wire transfer regulations and found nothing. I searched for the general terms and agreements on my account and found nothing. I searched for terms and agreements on currency conversions and found nothing. There is no way I could have understood the conditions of receiving the Yen into my bank account. The manager of the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX branch did not direct me to read any terms and conditions. I informed her of the upcoming wire transfer in Yen and all she told me was that it would be a {$15.00} fee no matter how much Yen was transferred. I asked if the bank performed any special tasks to receive the funds and she said no that the bank received millions of large transfers daily and that there was nothing special for me to do or know. 
Wells Fargo did not inform me of the conversion rate before they applied it. 
They are known for fraudulently setting up accounts in people 's names that did not request those accounts. Now, I believe they make fraudulent conversions of foreign wire transfers and mix up the paper trail to cover their manuevers. 
Thank you for helping me."

The give personal information to family members that are not authorized to have it. They are breaking the law. 

Portfolio Recovery has been hounding and threatening me constantly for years. They need to be stopped and I want the old debts that they are chasing off of my credit report."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2018, I called in to close my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card as the annual fee had come due and I was not interested in keeping the card open for another year. The account was closed with no problem. I received an e-mail on XX/XX/2018 stating that not only did I have a past due balance but that I had been charged interested on the annual fee. I called on XX/XX/2018 to resolve the issue and was told that even though I closed the account they were still going to charge the annual fee and were still expecting me to pay this. This makes no sense to me as I shouldn't have to pay a fee for an account that I no longer have open. Additionally, Synchrony is no longer running the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card program AT ALL after XX/XX/2018 anyway so there wouldn't even be a full year to use the card."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I opened an account with a brokerage firm that turned out to be a total scam. They call themselves XXXX. I used PayPal for the deposits. XXXX apparently uses a company called XXXX to accept the deposits for them. When I requested a withdrawal they told me that they issue withdrawals in the form of refunds back to PayPal. I still havent received any refunds. They always give me some lame excuse and then put the money I requested to withdrawal back into their fraudulent worthless XXXX account and act like I got my money back. Complete fraudsters. So I ask PayPal to return my stolen money since they were used by this fake broker to defraud me. PayPal said Oh, we dont cover this kind of purchase. Okay, so that means that PayPal is knowingly doing business with a fraudulent company and helping them scam people. Pretty pathetic! I just want my money back that these crooks stole from me!"
